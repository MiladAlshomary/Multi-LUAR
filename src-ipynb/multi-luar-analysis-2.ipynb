We had two newer servers on and one experienced server who wanted to get cut first. With newer servers it’s hard because we can’t tell how much they can handle at once until we get used to working with them.\\n\\nAnyways I seat a four top with a reservation and they were super nice. It was pretty busy, but Saturday nights are always busy (I work in a big city too)\\n\\nThey got drinks but then out of the blue they all get up to leave and tell my co-host and I they’re leaving because the server has been gone for forever and it’s not worth it. It’s such an awkward position to be in because wtf am I supposed to do other than say I’m so sorry. Plea with them to stay? Grab my manager? I actually couldn’t get my manager because she was running around like a madwoman all night.\\n\\nSo they left and it was just like ….\\n\\nThen an hour later we sat another four top with a reservation and legit same thing. They leave without even being watered (I’m not sure if they were greeted because sometimes customers flip the glasses over themselves)\\n\\nI felt bad for the server but my hands were tied so I had to seat the them. Sometimes I’ll check in with servers when I’ve noticed a table hasn’t been watered but sometimes they get annoyed and go “I know…” or “they can wait” But what am I supposed to say when people tell us they’re leaving because of slow service????</td>\n",

One time a host turned away a 14 top, 14 top emailed manager and host got fired (for other reasons too but that was a big part of it)\\n\\nAnyways today at lunch we got maybe 300000 walk-ins and it was stressful but I made it work. My manager comes running out saying how the kitchen is slammed and I need to stop taking people. I’m like ok cool that’s actually good because there’s only two servers on anyways and they’re weeded.\\n\\nIt finally dies down and I ask my mgr if the kitchen hates me.

The acting is beyond good, as &lt;PERSON&gt;, &lt;PERSON&gt;, and &lt;PERSON&gt; absolutely blew me away with their performances. Also, the action sequences and suspense were very well done, as I was on the edge of my seat during these instances.\\n\\nUsually I'm not fond of films made before 1980, but I made an exception to watch this on because of its critical acclaim. I was scared that the film would be boring because of a combination between this and its near 3 hour duration, but I couldn't keep my eyes off of the screen.\\n\\nSo all in all, The Godfather is a fast-paced, entertaining film with stellar performances.

We have bought both washable and disposable diapers and recently I’ve been working on making washable pads to help extend the life of the washable diapers throughout the day (still trying to find the best materials for effectiveness).\\n\\nWhen we got her, she had urine burns and a very swollen vulva with lesions. It’s been almost a couple of weeks now and she is looking much better because we change out her diapers at least every 3 hours (and the pad inserts every 1.5 hours). The pad inserts don’t have a leak proof back, so I have found that they aren’t really prolonging the use of the diapers when compared to using the diapers without. Our girl drinks a lot of water and I know some people limit it, but I don’t have the heart to make her go thirsty.\\n\\nIf you have a similar special needs pup, can you share your hygiene tips and tricks? I’m curious to know if we are doing this correctly or if others have found better methods.</td>\n",

Before we adopted, we spent hours communicating with the foster to make sure we understood what we were getting ourselves into. She is our first ever special needs animal, and we really wanted to give her a loving home.\\n\\nWhen we asked about her conditions and how they impact her quality of life and longevity, they seemed super optimistic. Everything was downplayed quite a bit. We had asked if her ectopic ureter would need surgery and they said no, she would just be a diaper baby the rest of her life. When I asked for copies of her medical records before adopting, we kept being told, “yeah, we will get that to you” and it never happened. We trusted what we were being told and moved forward with adopting before seeing her actual medical records (I know, rookie mistake).\\n\\nNow, after taking her to the vet that originally diagnosed her conditions, I find out that she was referred to surgery last year but the rescue opted not to. As a result, our dog is developing new issues that are costing a lot of money and we need to decide if we will move forward with surgery to give her a healthier life. We don’t know how much it will cost yet, but based on what the vet said, it can be anywhere between $2000-$10000 (and no one does it locally so we have to go to another city!). My partner was just laid off from his job, so the timing really sucks.\\n\\nI’m so exhausted at this point with how much work she has been, and now financially we will be hurting too. The vet was shocked that the rescue never mentioned her surgery referral, and I’m so upset that they didn’t either. I love my dog and want to give this girl a happy life, but we are having regrets now. We are in over our heads. I hate myself for feeling this way because I do view her as family. The rescue/foster have ghosted us too, so that doesn’t feel great.\\n\\nIf anyone else has experience with ectopic ureters I would love to hear your story to help me not feel so alone with this. Or, if you just have some words of encouragement, I could use those too.</td>\n",

       "      <td>&lt;PERSON&gt;\\n\\nIt appears that &lt;PERSON&gt; has finally succumbed to the idea that “researching the movie for 2 hours afterward just to understand it” is the same thing as having real thematic depth and substance. Yes, if I watch this again, I will understand the plot more clearly. But will I gain anything beyond that? This is the first high-concept &lt;PERSON&gt; film where I don’t even really care to figure out the puzzle.\\n\\nI don’t know, man. It was a cool experience, with plenty of fun moments and some solid payoffs; though really, it often feels like a mish-mash of many things &lt;PERSON&gt; has achieved better (and more focused) in his previous films, from the ouroboros “time loop” framing device to the parallel timelines and doppelgängers. This is such a simple story, littered with sci-fi hallmarks and cliches, masquerading as something entirely new and subversive simply because it’s steeped in information and content. Often, it’s not even the crazy time-twisting that is hard to follow, it’s the basic scene-to-scene transitions and context for why we’re watching what we’re watching in the first place. Even the exposition is just dull; and &lt;PERSON&gt; at least usually manages to make wordy explanations fun to watch.\\n\\nI just don’t feel edified or fulfilled or changed or even challenged at all by this. It’s like a multi-million-dollar cinematic party trick made solely to impress, gaining points only by overwhelming the audience with an onslaught of convoluted jargon and then saying “aye, if you don’t get this, you probably weren’t paying close enough attention to the mumbled and incomprehensible expository dialogue.”\\n\\nI’m glad it exists. I’m glad &lt;PERSON&gt; is making the things he wants to make. Some of the stuff close to the end was pretty exhilarating in its sheer technical wizardry. And ya know, I guess it’s okay that we have different types of movies that fulfill different purposes. Some movies are just kinda nifty and dope and trying to have some fun with an idea, and that’s totally cool. I’m totally understanding of why lots of people will probably dig it! But I’d much rather watch the last 10 minutes of the new Bill &amp; Ted and cry my eyes out again.</td>\n",

       "13  Tables that leave\\n\\nAs a host-nothing is more awkward/uncomfortable than when a table gets up and leaves because of the service.\\n\\nTonight was overall a terrible shift. We had two newer servers on and one experienced server who wanted to get cut first. With newer servers it’s hard because we can’t tell how much they can handle at once until we get used to working with them.\\n\\nAnyways I seat a four top with a reservation and they were super nice. It was pretty busy, but Saturday nights are always busy (I work in a big city too)\\n\\nThey got drinks but then out of the blue they all get up to leave and tell my co-host and I they’re leaving because the server has been gone for forever and it’s not worth it. It’s such an awkward position to be in because wtf am I supposed to do other than say I’m so sorry. Plea with them to stay? Grab my manager? I actually couldn’t get my manager because she was running around like a madwoman all night.\\n\\nSo they left and it was just like ….\\n\\nThen an hour later we sat another four top with a reservation and legit same thing. They leave without even being watered (I’m not sure if they were greeted because sometimes customers flip the glasses over themselves)\\n\\nI felt bad for the server but my hands were tied so I had to seat the them. Sometimes I’ll check in with servers when I’ve noticed a table hasn’t been watered but sometimes they get annoyed and go “I know…” or “they can wait” But what am I supposed to say when people tell us they’re leaving because of slow service????   \n",

We have bought both washable and disposable diapers and recently I’ve been working on making washable pads to help extend the life of the washable diapers throughout the day (still trying to find the best materials for effectiveness).\\n\\nWhen we got her, she had urine burns and a very swollen vulva with lesions. It’s been almost a couple of weeks now and she is looking much better because we change out her diapers at least every 3 hours (and the pad inserts every 1.5 hours). The pad inserts don’t have a leak proof back, so I have found that they aren’t really prolonging the use of the diapers when compared to using the diapers without. Our girl drinks a lot of water and I know some people limit it, but I don’t have the heart to make her go thirsty.\\n\\nIf you have a similar special needs pup, can you share your hygiene tips and tricks? I’m curious to know if we are doing this correctly or if others have found better methods.   \n",

Anyways my manager’s whole ordeal is never say no. Business is business. If an eight top comes in without a reservation it doesn’t matter you seat them like that kind of manager. One time a host turned away a 14 top, 14 top emailed manager and host got fired (for other reasons too but that was a big part of it)\\n\\nAnyways today at lunch we got maybe 300000 walk-ins and it was stressful but I made it work. My manager comes running out saying how the kitchen is slammed and I need to stop taking people. I’m like ok cool that’s actually good because there’s only two servers on anyways and they’re weeded.\\n\\nIt finally dies down and I ask my mgr if the kitchen hates me. She just goes\\n\\n“Um…..I mean they were dying in there they had so many tickets”\\n\\nSo does the kitchen hate me? And hosts in general?   \n",

None of these things turned out to be true, and I'm very delighted by this.\\n\\nA film being called the best movie of all-time definitely will be called overrated by most, but this film is just excellent in every aspect. Its story is as masterful and interesting as any other great film from this day and age. The acting is beyond good, as <PERSON>, <PERSON>, and <PERSON> absolutely blew me away with their performances. Also, the action sequences and suspense were very well done, as I was on the edge of my seat during these instances.\\n\\nUsually I'm not fond of films made before 1980, but I made an exception to watch this on because of its critical acclaim. I was scared that the film would be boring because of a combination between this and its near 3 hour duration, but I couldn't keep my eyes off of the screen.\\n\\nSo all in all, The Godfather is a fast-paced, entertaining film with stellar performances. Although I wouldn't call it the best film of all time, The Godfather is indeed a masterpiece.   \n",
       "15  I feel like the rescue we adopted from did not set us up for success\\n\\nMy partner and I adopted a special needs pup (1yr old) who has hip dysplasia and an ectopic ureter. Before we adopted, we spent hours communicating with the foster to make sure we understood what we were getting ourselves into. She is our first ever special needs animal, and we really wanted to give her a loving home.\\n\\nWhen we asked about her conditions and how they impact her quality of life and longevity, they seemed super optimistic. Everything was downplayed quite a bit. We had asked if her ectopic ureter would need surgery and they said no, she would just be a diaper baby the rest of her life. When I asked for copies of her medical records before adopting, we kept being told, “yeah, we will get that to you” and it never happened. We trusted what we were being told and moved forward with adopting before seeing her actual medical records (I know, rookie mistake).\\n\\nNow, after taking her to the vet that originally diagnosed her conditions, I find out that she was referred to surgery last year but the rescue opted not to. As a result, our dog is developing new issues that are costing a lot of money and we need to decide if we will move forward with surgery to give her a healthier life. We don’t know how much it will cost yet, but based on what the vet said, it can be anywhere between $2000-$10000 (and no one does it locally so we have to go to another city!). My partner was just laid off from his job, so the timing really sucks.\\n\\nI’m so exhausted at this point with how much work she has been, and now financially we will be hurting too. The vet was shocked that the rescue never mentioned her surgery referral, and I’m so upset that they didn’t either. I love my dog and want to give this girl a happy life, but we are having regrets now. We are in over our heads. I hate myself for feeling this way because I do view her as family. The rescue/foster have ghosted us too, so that doesn’t feel great.\\n\\nIf anyone else has experience with ectopic ureters I would love to hear your story to help me not feel so alone with this. Or, if you just have some words of encouragement, I could use those too.   \n",

       "17                         <PERSON>\\n\\nIt appears that <PERSON> has finally succumbed to the idea that “researching the movie for 2 hours afterward just to understand it” is the same thing as having real thematic depth and substance. Yes, if I watch this again, I will understand the plot more clearly. But will I gain anything beyond that? This is the first high-concept <PERSON> film where I don’t even really care to figure out the puzzle.\\n\\nI don’t know, man. It was a cool experience, with plenty of fun moments and some solid payoffs; though really, it often feels like a mish-mash of many things <PERSON> has achieved better (and more focused) in his previous films, from the ouroboros “time loop” framing device to the parallel timelines and doppelgängers. This is such a simple story, littered with sci-fi hallmarks and cliches, masquerading as something entirely new and subversive simply because it’s steeped in information and content. Often, it’s not even the crazy time-twisting that is hard to follow, it’s the basic scene-to-scene transitions and context for why we’re watching what we’re watching in the first place. Even the exposition is just dull; and <PERSON> at least usually manages to make wordy explanations fun to watch.\\n\\nI just don’t feel edified or fulfilled or changed or even challenged at all by this. It’s like a multi-million-dollar cinematic party trick made solely to impress, gaining points only by overwhelming the audience with an onslaught of convoluted jargon and then saying “aye, if you don’t get this, you probably weren’t paying close enough attention to the mumbled and incomprehensible expository dialogue.”\\n\\nI’m glad it exists. I’m glad <PERSON> is making the things he wants to make. Some of the stuff close to the end was pretty exhilarating in its sheer technical wizardry. And ya know, I guess it’s okay that we have different types of movies that fulfill different purposes. Some movies are just kinda nifty and dope and trying to have some fun with an idea, and that’s totally cool. I’m totally understanding of why lots of people will probably dig it! But I’d much rather watch the last 10 minutes of the new Bill & Ted and cry my eyes out again.   \n",

But Mother!, clearly inspired by the state of the world today, ends most of the time by becoming confused and overly bizarre, instead of creating a certain subtlety in the messages, throwing us all over the place at the same time.\\n\\nThe maternal side, and as the title indicates, is perhaps the greatest aspect to be explored, and creation the focal point of history. Not only the mother as a physical figure, but also mother nature, the person who creates life, whose love has to be respected because it is unique and irreplaceable. Humanity is obsessed with less important things, not attaching to the most significant details, letting appearances follow a path of self-destruction. It may be unique, or we would not be talking about &lt;PERSON&gt;, and I even realize where he wants to get, but the way he chooses to come up with the biggest metaphor of them all becomes too bizarre and tiring to watch, especially the last half an hour of film. However, the paradoxes between past and modern times, where social criticism, on gender equality issues and the desire to achieve fame, are connected to obsessional thirst to idolize the famous pseudo-figures for no apparent reason. The religious component is also very strong, as is the picture of the present world, uncontrolled and unthinking.\\n\\nWhen I give negative to the film, I think at the same time of the importance of what &lt;PERSON&gt; wants to do with this work. It's a mixture of feelings. While one side of me wants to give him credit, another thinks that the extreme difference that characterizes him is worthy of prominence, and probably will be one of those that will provoke varied discussions about what is visualized.</td>\n",

An interesting set of situations and characters, but that is not too different from many other of that kind. The presence of &lt;PERSON&gt; shows once again that she is one of the most interesting females of her generation. I liked what I saw, but I always demanded more of what &lt;PERSON&gt; had for me.

       "      <td>mother!\\n\\nLike the exclamation point at the end of your title, Mother! wants to provoke, to indignate, to show a strong objective. &lt;PERSON&gt; is known for the difference and for wanting to always show a more metaphorical and surreal side of the themes, and this his new film is no exception. But Mother!, clearly inspired by the state of the world today, ends most of the time by becoming confused and overly bizarre, instead of creating a certain subtlety in the messages, throwing us all over the place at the same time.\\n\\nThe maternal side, and as the title indicates, is perhaps the greatest aspect to be explored, and creation the focal point of history. Not only the mother as a physical figure, but also mother nature, the person who creates life, whose love has to be respected because it is unique and irreplaceable. Humanity is obsessed with less important things, not attaching to the most significant details, letting appearances follow a path of self-destruction. It may be unique, or we would not be talking about &lt;PERSON&gt;, and I even realize where he wants to get, but the way he chooses to come up with the biggest metaphor of them all becomes too bizarre and tiring to watch, especially the last half an hour of film. However, the paradoxes between past and modern times, where social criticism, on gender equality issues and the desire to achieve fame, are connected to obsessional thirst to idolize the famous pseudo-figures for no apparent reason. The religious component is also very strong, as is the picture of the present world, uncontrolled and unthinking.\\n\\nWhen I give negative to the film, I think at the same time of the importance of what &lt;PERSON&gt; wants to do with this work. It's a mixture of feelings. While one side of me wants to give him credit, another thinks that the extreme difference that characterizes him is worthy of prominence, and probably will be one of those that will provoke varied discussions about what is visualized.</td>\n",

Even though this film gets a ton of well deserved hate it does have a few redeeming qualities. The best and most interesting part of this film is how the building is used as an inescapable labyrinth filled with elevators, escalators, doors, windows, water, ice, mirrors, blank walls and long halls. The way they used those elements along with the reflection based scares led to some interesting effects and pretty enjoyable scenes. It creates a disturbing environment where the viewer never really knows where in the building they are. The characters go down two different elevators to get to a parking garage then they descend again into a mall area and then down again on escalators to finally arrive at the buildings lobby. It must have been built by the same architect that built the Overlook. Being trapped in a confusing and disturbing high rise while being able to see the safe normal world outside is a great place for a haunting/possession story. If this wasn’t a &lt;PERSON&gt; film I think I might have actually enjoyed it but it’s not. It’s a mean spirited half baked cash grab.</td>\n",

There’s so much to hate on I don’t know where to start. I hate the victim shaming psychologist, I hate how they just did away with &lt;PERSON&gt;, I hate that they dropped the family for the chance to make another film and I hate that they tried to use &lt;PERSON&gt; again. Even though this film gets a ton of well deserved hate it does have a few redeeming qualities. The best and most interesting part of this film is how the building is used as an inescapable labyrinth filled with elevators, escalators, doors, windows, water, ice, mirrors, blank walls and long halls. The way they used those elements along with the reflection based scares led to some interesting effects and pretty enjoyable scenes. It creates a disturbing environment where the viewer never really knows where in the building they are. The characters go down two different elevators to get to a parking garage then they descend again into a mall area and then down again on escalators to finally arrive at the buildings lobby. It must have been built by the same architect that built the Overlook. Being trapped in a confusing and disturbing high rise while being able to see the safe normal world outside is a great place for a haunting/possession story. If this wasn’t a &lt;PERSON&gt; film I think I might have actually enjoyed it but it’s not. It’s a mean spirited half baked cash grab.</td>\n",

       "      <td>\"You have to get as low as possible!!!\"\\n\\nThis happened when I was teaching from 2010-2011 in Arizona. For the sake of the sub, I'll say that I worked at a school that happened to have a classroom full of adult-aged fifth graders. They had the same maturity as 5th graders, learning 5th and 6th grade Math.\\n\\nAt \"Scrappy-Doo Charter School for Adults\", which actually happened to moonlight as a University of Phoenix campus, I got the upstairs corner office/classroom. I had two walls that were completely windows, 100 percent see through panes. It made it difficult in some ways (like not enough wall space), but overall it worked out. The students loved being able to look outside and see the entire neighborhood. When I say ALL windows, I mean ALL... I'm 6'2\", and from slightly above my knees all the way up to the ceiling it was see through panes of glass. It was gorgeous.\\n\\nDespite being a school that teaches \"Adult fifth graders\" and beyond, we had lockdown procedures that we practiced monthly. During a lockdown, all staff and students had to be \"below all outward-facing windows\" for the entire lockdown. I had the group of us sit criss-cross applesauce (which was fun to see with this group of Billy-Madison style giant fifth graders) and we took turns telling scary stories in a whisper.\\n\\nMy principal did NOT like this one bit. He burst in during our Mockdown and yelled at everybody, saying \"You have to be as low as possible so you don't DIE from a stray BULLET!\". Wow. Despite these kids being adults, they were still, in a sense, kids. Way to freak them out for next time, asshole.\\n\\n​\\n\\nAnyway, wouldn't you know it, a month and a half later something goes down at the \"Handler Mall\" where a domestic dispute turns into a kidnapping by gunpoint. The man took his former significant other around, right past our school. We went on lockdown quickly, and this time I was ready for some mighty fine MC.\\n\\n​\\n\\nWe got as low as possible. We all had pillows and blankets that I let them previously stash, brand new, in our closets in backup cubbies, and we all had nap time. Me included. I did not plan on laying down and actually sleeping, I just wanted to see the look on my principal's face when he saw a room full of manchildren having naptime during an actual emergency and lockdown. I got to see his face after hearing him bang on my door, which I somehow propped shut with a chair. His furious face made me so friggin happy. It's one of the best joys of my life, along with those \"kids\". They were all great.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Malicious StinkPliance: &lt;PERSON&gt; style\\n\\nThis story answers the question “what’s the most horrible smell you’ve ever smelled?”\\n\\nWhen you hit your mid forties, your brain gets, well, weird. I was reading a story about dead fish and instantly got brought back to a story I had long since forgotten, back in the recesses of my withering mind. Back when I was a cashier for a large grocery store that is a homonym for my favorite food.\\n\\nI had plenty of experience in retail, as I previously worked at a cross town rival for many years. I found my self cashiering for a manager who perpetually treated me like an idiot, and despite being able to tell people their change before I punch in the total, he insists that I “stop showing off like a little asshole”. Um excuse me? I’m 6 2 280. I’m far from little. Anyway, this is really all unrelated except that he didn’t like me, repeatedly nsukted me, and watched me like a hawk.\\n\\nI was scanning groceries for some resting-confused-faced lady who looked at the screen after every scan as if she just arrived on the planet. I finally get to a stack of cat food cans that looks suspiciously stuck together. I used to stock groceries , and have seen this before; cat food cans damaged and get stuck together. My old boss said to scan if we CAN (his stupid joke lol ) and toss in the bin. That’s all the training I ever received.\\n\\nSo anyways Manager HatesTheWorld is bagging, the lady is looking like she’s studying the particles in the air, and I take the double can and put it off to the side to get ready to call for a replacement.\\n\\nBefore I could say a thing, the lady gets huffy and says to just “separate the cans , don’t be an idiot”. This got the attention of Manager &lt;PERSON&gt; as he says “you heard her, separate the cans!”\\n\\nOkay. YOU get some MC, You get some MC, Everybody’s going home today with some MC!\\n\\nI saw that the twocan was expired. I knew that this wasn’t going to be good. Even cat food cans that weren’t expired were gross when they got stuck together. I admittedly protested initially, but I was shut down pretty quickly, so I grabbed two plastic bags as gloves, opened the cans (A difficult task) and it literally popped as I pried it. The most disgusting looking, smelling zhit permeated the air. We shut down my lane. Confused lady is now grossed out lady covered In what used to be cat food. She just leaves. I run to the restroom to wash up, come out to see my manager cleaning up the mess with his head turned away.\\n\\n“What are you doing, help me!”\\n\\nOh I’m sorry, I’m highly reactive to horrible smells!” I reply.\\n\\nThis isn’t normally true , but for this particular smell, I just couldn’t. Knowing what botulism most likely was there, I suggested having them fill out a report and call some people, as per OSHA MSDS requirements.\\n\\nThings eventually got cleaned up, and valuable lessons about health and safety were learned by all that day\\n\\nSorry cuz mobile.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Malicious StinkPliance: &lt;PERSON&gt; style\\n\\nThis story answers the question “what’s the most horrible smell you’ve ever smelled?”\\n\\nWhen you hit your mid forties, your brain gets, well, weird. I was reading a story about dead fish and instantly got brought back to a story I had long since forgotten, back in the recesses of my withering mind. Back when I was a cashier for a large grocery store that is a homonym for my favorite food.\\n\\nI had plenty of experience in retail, as I previously worked at a cross town rival for many years. I found my self cashiering for a manager who perpetually treated me like an idiot, and despite being able to tell people their change before I punch in the total, he insists that I “stop showing off like a little asshole”. Um excuse me? I’m 6 2 280. I’m far from little. Anyway, this is really all unrelated except that he didn’t like me, repeatedly nsukted me, and watched me like a hawk.\\n\\nI was scanning groceries for some resting-confused-faced lady who looked at the screen after every scan as if she just arrived on the planet. I finally get to a stack of cat food cans that looks suspiciously stuck together. I used to stock groceries , and have seen this before; cat food cans damaged and get stuck together. My old boss said to scan if we CAN (his stupid joke lol ) and toss in the bin. That’s all the training I ever received.\\n\\nSo anyways Manager HatesTheWorld is bagging, the lady is looking like she’s studying the particles in the air, and I take the double can and put it off to the side to get ready to call for a replacement.\\n\\nBefore I could say a thing, the lady gets huffy and says to just “separate the cans , don’t be an idiot”. This got the attention of Manager &lt;PERSON&gt; as he says “you heard her, separate the cans!”\\n\\nOkay. YOU get some MC, You get some MC, Everybody’s going home today with some MC!\\n\\nI saw that the twocan was expired. I knew that this wasn’t going to be good. Even cat food cans that weren’t expired were gross when they got stuck together. I admittedly protested initially, but I was shut down pretty quickly, so I grabbed two plastic bags as gloves, opened the cans (A difficult task) and it literally popped as I pried it. The most disgusting looking, smelling zhit permeated the air. We shut down my lane. Confused lady is now grossed out lady covered In what used to be cat food. She just leaves. I run to the restroom to wash up, come out to see my manager cleaning up the mess with his head turned away.\\n\\n“What are you doing, help me!”\\n\\nOh I’m sorry, I’m highly reactive to horrible smells!” I reply.\\n\\nThis isn’t normally true , but for this particular smell, I just couldn’t. Knowing what botulism most likely was there, I suggested having them fill out a report and call some people, as per OSHA MSDS requirements.\\n\\nThings eventually got cleaned up, and valuable lessons about health and safety were learned by all that day\\n\\nSorry cuz mobile.</td>\n",
       "      <td>\"You have to get as low as possible!!!\"\\n\\nThis happened when I was teaching from 2010-2011 in Arizona. For the sake of the sub, I'll say that I worked at a school that happened to have a classroom full of adult-aged fifth graders. They had the same maturity as 5th graders, learning 5th and 6th grade Math.\\n\\nAt \"Scrappy-Doo Charter School for Adults\", which actually happened to moonlight as a University of Phoenix campus, I got the upstairs corner office/classroom. I had two walls that were completely windows, 100 percent see through panes. It made it difficult in some ways (like not enough wall space), but overall it worked out. The students loved being able to look outside and see the entire neighborhood. When I say ALL windows, I mean ALL... I'm 6'2\", and from slightly above my knees all the way up to the ceiling it was see through panes of glass. It was gorgeous.\\n\\nDespite being a school that teaches \"Adult fifth graders\" and beyond, we had lockdown procedures that we practiced monthly. During a lockdown, all staff and students had to be \"below all outward-facing windows\" for the entire lockdown. I had the group of us sit criss-cross applesauce (which was fun to see with this group of Billy-Madison style giant fifth graders) and we took turns telling scary stories in a whisper.\\n\\nMy principal did NOT like this one bit. He burst in during our Mockdown and yelled at everybody, saying \"You have to be as low as possible so you don't DIE from a stray BULLET!\". Wow. Despite these kids being adults, they were still, in a sense, kids. Way to freak them out for next time, asshole.\\n\\n​\\n\\nAnyway, wouldn't you know it, a month and a half later something goes down at the \"Handler Mall\" where a domestic dispute turns into a kidnapping by gunpoint. The man took his former significant other around, right past our school. We went on lockdown quickly, and this time I was ready for some mighty fine MC.\\n\\n​\\n\\nWe got as low as possible. We all had pillows and blankets that I let them previously stash, brand new, in our closets in backup cubbies, and we all had nap time. Me included. I did not plan on laying down and actually sleeping, I just wanted to see the look on my principal's face when he saw a room full of manchildren having naptime during an actual emergency and lockdown. I got to see his face after hearing him bang on my door, which I somehow propped shut with a chair. His furious face made me so friggin happy. It's one of the best joys of my life, along with those \"kids\". They were all great.</td>\n",

She has her own instantly likable charm to her, but also a crafty, shady side of her own. You see why her character can win so many people over in the film despite their better judgements. Then there's &lt;PERSON&gt; whose sinister eyes mixed with a slimy, dangerous exterior makes for a damn good antagonist.\\n\\nI only had two problems with the film and they were more personal problems that actual problems with the film.

There's one scene where it works effectively, but that's it for me. Maybe it'll grow on me the more I watch this. And the other problem is that the movie left me wanting more. It's not a bad ending--great ending--but you can tell they set up an Easy Rawlins franchise we never got and it's so disappointing when you think about what could've been. I would've loved seeing countless Easy Rawlins sequels. But knowing we didn't get it--to loosely quote something &lt;PERSON&gt; said on his &lt;PERSON&gt; podcast--it's like watching a &lt;PERSON&gt; origin story end as soon as &lt;PERSON&gt; puts on the cowl for the first time.\\n\\nDespite those minor things, I kind of loved Devil in a Blue Dress and it's still pretty high on not only my list of favorite &lt;PERSON&gt; features (probably my 2nd fave &lt;PERSON&gt; film), but favorite films PERIOD.\\n\\nAnd again, if you do end up watching (or rewatching) this, make sure to turn the color down on your tv/computer.

The film's stripped down approache and the super fluid narrative makes up a pretty simple yet compelling watch.\\n\\nThe main focal point of this film is how multi-faceted each student is, and how their pov is different from each other. The main character of Annie is perhaps the professional victim of the head professor's own personal prejudice against him. The casual approach which the authorities carry out their official duties, and many such aspects of the student's life is shown with great details. Also the rebellious and woke undertones that this film carries throughout, until the end is very interesting and introspective to look at.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Contempt\\n\\nPainstakingly &amp; helplessly witnessing the decay of marriage, two people falling out of love like deck of cards\\n&lt;PERSON&gt; is a huge name in Cinema, and he acquires that spot rightfully. A revolutionary of all sorts, a trait that I've always admired in filmmakers, and watching my first &lt;PERSON&gt; on the big screen is a dream come true. A strictly dialogue oriented cinema which is cruel to witness as how &lt;PERSON&gt; makes the audiences helpless.\\n\\nA film that starts off as a conflict of interests between a producer, who can be called as a narcissistic man and the director regarding how the realized film should look. This debate eventually sees the entry of a new screenwriter who has to edit certain scenes according to the producer.

The film's stripped down approache and the super fluid narrative makes up a pretty simple yet compelling watch.\\n\\nThe main focal point of this film is how multi-faceted each student is, and how their pov is different from each other. The main character of Annie is perhaps the professional victim of the head professor's own personal prejudice against him. The casual approach which the authorities carry out their official duties, and many such aspects of the student's life is shown with great details. Also the rebellious and woke undertones that this film carries throughout, until the end is very interesting and introspective to look at.</td>\n",

I was reading a story about dead fish and instantly got brought back to a story I had long since forgotten, back in the recesses of my withering mind. Back when I was a cashier for a large grocery store that is a homonym for my favorite food.\\n\\nI had plenty of experience in retail, as I previously worked at a cross town rival for many years. I found my self cashiering for a manager who perpetually treated me like an idiot, and despite being able to tell people their change before I punch in the total, he insists that I “stop showing off like a little asshole”. Um excuse me? I’m 6 2 280. I’m far from little. Anyway, this is really all unrelated except that he didn’t like me, repeatedly nsukted me, and watched me like a hawk.\\n\\nI was scanning groceries for some resting-confused-faced lady who looked at the screen after every scan as if she just arrived on the planet. I finally get to a stack of cat food cans that looks suspiciously stuck together. I used to stock groceries , and have seen this before; cat food cans damaged and get stuck together. My old boss said to scan if we CAN (his stupid joke lol ) and toss in the bin. That’s all the training I ever received.\\n\\nSo anyways Manager HatesTheWorld is bagging, the lady is looking like she’s studying the particles in the air, and I take the double can and put it off to the side to get ready to call for a replacement.\\n\\nBefore I could say a thing, the lady gets huffy and says to just “separate the cans , don’t be an idiot”. This got the attention of Manager &lt;PERSON&gt; as he says “you heard her, separate the cans!”\\n\\nOkay. YOU get some MC, You get some MC, Everybody’s going home today with some MC!\\n\\nI saw that the twocan was expired. I knew that this wasn’t going to be good. Even cat food cans that weren’t expired were gross when they got stuck together. I admittedly protested initially, but I was shut down pretty quickly, so I grabbed two plastic bags as gloves, opened the cans (A difficult task) and it literally popped as I pried it. The most disgusting looking, smelling zhit permeated the air. We shut down my lane. Confused lady is now grossed out lady covered In what used to be cat food. She just leaves. I run to the restroom to wash up, come out to see my manager cleaning up the mess with his head turned away.\\n\\n“What are you doing, help me!”\\n\\nOh I’m sorry, I’m highly reactive to horrible smells!” I reply.\\n\\nThis isn’t normally true , but for this particular smell, I just couldn’t. Knowing what botulism most likely was there, I suggested having them fill out a report and call some people, as per OSHA MSDS requirements.\\n\\nThings eventually got cleaned up, and valuable lessons about health and safety were learned by all that day\\n\\nSorry cuz mobile.</td>\n",

Passionate and deed-based, yet unfocused, individualistic, and most importantly focused on the liberation of the consumer rather than the worker. Consumption of product under the guise of doing something more worthwhile, is at the heart of Falling Down, from the very first scene the toothy snarl of a <PERSON> plushy sets off “D-fens’s” rage, causing him to skip work for that day, instead starting and unhinged consumer revolution, holding up fast food stores and bodegas, using threats of violence as leverage for enhanced convenience. Although he still seems “countercultural” and on the side of the people, this focus on the consumer is in reality inherently anti-revolutionary, screwing over those who make the products even more. <PERSON> does an excellent job at portraying the misguided revolutionary in this biting and sardonic satire.   \n",

It could reasonably assumed based on the trees and New York location that this movie ends sometime around early to mid September. I know I’m just over analyzing this but that means either:\\n\\nA. This film ends less than a week before 9/11, and symbolically may be one of the bleakest endings ever made.\\n\\nB.

That's what we get to see here and I LOVED IT.\\n\\nWe see everything through <PERSON> unprejudiced eyes: from pleasure, to relationships, to control, and toxicity, and the way some men view and desire women and why, to work and self-reliance, to daddy issues, and money, and empathy, and guilt... EVERYTHING. And it was the most fun and refreshing journey ever, filled with unique characters and hilariously deep dialogue that I will never forget.\\n\\nI feel like <PERSON> always sits down about to write a script and goes: \"WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF...\" and then produces the most primal, deconstructed, insanely original story that's not fully rooted in reality but it's also somehow very pragmatic and also idealistic at the same time???\\n\\nIt's just genius, and the epitome of film innovation imo.\\nHis existence makes me excited for movies.\\nCan't wait to see what he'll do next.\\n\\nAlso <PERSON> performance was an experience on its own and I LOVED <PERSON> in this.\\n\\n—\\n\\nES\\n\\nImaginen re-experimentar y re-aprender el mundo a través de una mirada sin prejuicios y altamente lógica que solo se podría conseguir despojándola de todo conocimiento preconcebido y todo constructo social y prácticamente volviendo a nacer, en un cuerpo que definitivamente va a estar expuesto a todo lo peor y todo lo mejor de este mundo, además. Eso es lo que vemos en esta película Y ME ENCANTÓ.\\n\\nVemos todo a través de los ojos imparciales de Bella Baxter: desde el placer, hasta las relaciones, el control, la toxicidad, la forma en la que algunos hombres ven y desean a las mujeres y por qué, el trabajo, la autosuficiencia, los daddy issues, el dinero, la empatía, la culpa... TODO. Y fue el viaje más divertido y refrescante de la vida, lleno de personajes súper únicos y diálogos graciosamente profundos que nunca voy a olvidar.\\n\\nSiento que <PERSON> siempre se sienta a escribir un guión y dice tipo: \"QUE PASARÍA SI...\" y termina creando la historia más elemental, deconstruida y ridículamente original que no está completamente arraigada en la realidad pero de alguna manera también es súper pragmática y al mismo tiempo idealista???\\n\\nEs una genialidad y el epítome de innovación en el cine, en mi opinión.\\nSu existencia me hace emocionarme por las películas.\\nY no puedo esperar a ver qué va a hacer en el futuro.\\n\\nTambién la actuación de <PERSON> fue una experiencia por sí sola y AMÉ a <PERSON> en esta peli.   \n",

And I think the story was very well executed. <PERSON>'s character's whole \"breaking bad\" was more nuanced than I expected it to be and the way it all unfolds was very believable to me. It was just a solid villain origin story imo. And the film itself is pretty entertaining which is a big bonus.\\n\\nAlso I was worried about all the singing but it wasn't cringe. It was fitting I guess.\\n\\nSame Hunger Games vibe but vintage, and it was super interesting to watch how the games started and how they evolved into what we know them as. This is the only book I never read from the series and I left the cinema dying to read it so...\\n\\nPretty great.\\n\\n—\\n\\nES\\n\\nGratamente sorprendida con esta película.\\n\\nLa disfruté mucho más de lo que pensé que la iba a disfrutar. Y pienso que la historia estuvo muy bien ejecutada. Todo el proceso de <PERSON> volviéndose malo tuvo más capas y profundidad de lo que yo esperaba, y la forma en la que se desarrolló todo fue súper creíble para mi. Me pareció una villain origin story bastante sólida. Y la película como tal es súper entretenida, que es un gran bonus.\\n\\nMe preocupaba un poco toda la cantadera pero no fue nada cringe. Quedababa bien.\\n\\nEs la misma vibra de The Hunger Games pero vintage, y fue súper interesante ver cómo los juegos empezaron y cómo evolucionaron hasta ser lo que nosotros conocemos. Este es el único libro de la serie que nunca leí y salí del cine muriendo por leerlo así que...\\n\\nBastante genial.   \n",

But Mother!, clearly inspired by the state of the world today, ends most of the time by becoming confused and overly bizarre, instead of creating a certain subtlety in the messages, throwing us all over the place at the same time.\\n\\nThe maternal side, and as the title indicates, is perhaps the greatest aspect to be explored, and creation the focal point of history. Not only the mother as a physical figure, but also mother nature, the person who creates life, whose love has to be respected because it is unique and irreplaceable. Humanity is obsessed with less important things, not attaching to the most significant details, letting appearances follow a path of self-destruction. It may be unique, or we would not be talking about <PERSON>, and I even realize where he wants to get, but the way he chooses to come up with the biggest metaphor of them all becomes too bizarre and tiring to watch, especially the last half an hour of film. However, the paradoxes between past and modern times, where social criticism, on gender equality issues and the desire to achieve fame, are connected to obsessional thirst to idolize the famous pseudo-figures for no apparent reason. The religious component is also very strong, as is the picture of the present world, uncontrolled and unthinking.\\n\\nWhen I give negative to the film, I think at the same time of the importance of what <PERSON> wants to do with this work. It's a mixture of feelings. While one side of me wants to give him credit, another thinks that the extreme difference that characterizes him is worthy of prominence, and probably will be one of those that will provoke varied discussions about what is visualized.   \n",

An interesting set of situations and characters, but that is not too different from many other of that kind. The presence of <PERSON> shows once again that she is one of the most interesting females of her generation. I liked what I saw, but I always demanded more of what <PERSON> had for me. There are quite honest moments on an emotional level, but the feeling that it's just another medium movie, from a medium 2017, with no big surprises overall.   \n",
       "14  <PERSON>, of <LOCATION>, passed away peacefully on <DATE_TIME>, at <DATE_TIME>. A visitation will be held on <DATE_TIME> from <DATE_TIME> and before Mass on <DATE_TIME> from <DATE_TIME> at Ballard-Sunder Funeral & Cremation, 833 South Marschall Road in <LOCATION>. Mass of Christian Burial will be held on <DATE_TIME> at <DATE_TIME> at the Parish of Saints Joachim and Anne (St. Mark’s Church) in <LOCATION>. <PERSON>’s grandchildren will act as urn bearers, and <PERSON> will be laid to rest with his beloved <PERSON> at Fort Snelling National Cemetery.\\n\\nOn <DATE_TIME> <PERSON> and <PERSON> celebrated the birth of their son, <PERSON>. He would become the middle child of 13. <PERSON> loved growing up on the family farm where developed a strong work ethic that followed him throughout his life. At <DATE_TIME> with his older brothers away at war and his father ill, <PERSON> had to leave school to run the farm. He returned to school when the situation stabilized. <PERSON> left school again as a senior to join the Army as the Korean Conflict was escalating. He was awarded a GED from Jordan High School. He was a dedicated soldier and received high security clearance as a radio operator. <PERSON> was honorably discharged in <DATE_TIME>. But he always remained proud of the fact that of the 13 kids, nine served in the military at some point. He was a longtime member of the VFW and American Legion.\\n\\nWhen he returned to civilian life, <PERSON> attended Brown Institute where he studied radio broadcasting. He received his Radio Broadcast Operator License, but never pursued a career in broadcasting. Instead <PERSON> began working for Continental Machines in <LOCATION>. He was a dedicated employee for <DATE_TIME>. <PERSON> met the love of his life, <PERSON>, in <DATE_TIME> and they exchanged wedding vows on <DATE_TIME>. They settled in <LOCATION> and were blessed with two wonderful children, <PERSON> and <PERSON>.\\n\\nNo matter how busy <PERSON> was, he always made time for the most important things in his life, faith, family, farming and friends. Because <PERSON> was Lutheran, <PERSON> took on primary responsibility for <PERSON> and <PERSON>’s Catholic upbringing. And take it on, he did. <PERSON> practiced and lived his faith as an example to <PERSON> and <PERSON> and was active at St. Mark’s. He was a Lifetime Member of the Shakopee Knights of Columbus Council #1685.\\n\\nOne of <PERSON>’s famous sayings was, “Idle time is wasted time, and wasted time is trouble.” Never one to sit still for very long, <PERSON> always kept busy. He was a very talented woodworker, an interest he picked up from his father-in-law, <PERSON>. Eighty-five homes contain a Grandfather Clock he built, 25 of which were prizes at St. Mark’s for their <DATE_TIME> Julifest. His talents also touched the homes of numerous family members and friends. <PERSON> lived but the motto “measure twice, cut once” but there may have been a slip-up here and there! No matter what project he was working on, you could be sure he’d have trouble marking his measurements. That’s because <PERSON> was constantly looking for his carpenter’s pencil.\\n\\nAnd as they say, you can take the boy out of the country but you can’t take the country out of the boy. <PERSON> was living proof of that. <PERSON>, <PERSON> and <PERSON> knew that <DATE_TIME> meant <PERSON> and <PERSON> would be going to “the farm”, usually <PERSON>’s but sometimes <PERSON>’s. And it better not rain <DATE_TIME>, as there was visible disappointment. <PERSON> was certain that sometimes <PERSON> was more concerned about the farm than the owners were!\\n\\n<PERSON> loved being a husband, father, grandpa and great-grandpa. He was always there to lend a helping hand when someone needed it, but he’d never ask for anything in return. He was a quiet leader and set a wonderful example for his family.   \n",

You can see it as a cool, laid-back American answer to “El Topo”. The film is a pleasantly hypnotizing experience thanks to <PERSON> monochrome cinematography, <PERSON> guitar score, the meditative tone, the allegorical images, the poetic dialogue, the deadpan humor, and the surreal, bizarre narrative. Furthermore, <PERSON> and <PERSON> make up one of the western genre´s most eccentric and memorable leading duos, and they are supported by an all-star cast. All in all, “Dead Man” is a unique and mesmerizing western mood piece and a top-tier <PERSON> film.   \n",

It´s an unrelentingly heartbreaking journey following a 12-year-old boy who has to look after himself and his three younger half-siblings (every child has a different father) after their mother abandoned them. <PERSON> grounded, naturalistic filmmaking approach eschews any kind of melodrama as we follow the daily struggles of the children in a string of immersive, involving slice of life vignettes. <PERSON> the fictional storyteller and <PERSON> the documentarian once again blend together to ultimately serve <PERSON>-eda the humanist. He portrays the suffering with great tenderness and finds beauty and hope in the unbreakable bond and unwavering spirit of the siblings. Speaking of the children, the young cast is phenomenal. In every scene, they´re natural and believable. In particular <PERSON> deserves to be mentioned when we talk about all-time great child actor performances. “Nobody Knows” is a delicate, subtle, and well-crafted slice of life family drama that elicits strong emotions. I felt the long runtime, the middle part kind of blurs together in my memory, and other <PERSON>-eda films ultimately gave me more to think about but on a purely empathetic level, it doesn´t get much rawer and more impactful than this movie.   \n",

Nothing terribly fancy from a story perspective, as everything is in service for the many, many gags on display here, but the nimble versatility of the scenario suits <PERSON>'s talents quite well in the early goings as perhaps the worst waiter in the world with the best luck as the Tramp's vindictive behaviors makes for a barrage of very funny jokes that almost makes you wonder just how much the film needed to change settings to the roller rink in the end. When it does finally arrive, though, you're very thankful that it did as <PERSON> on skates is quite a sight to behold for his remarkable form that makes even the pratfalls (often not his own, I might add!) look as graceful as the more expert maneuvers he pulls off, well before chaos reigns once more in a cacophony of collisions that spurs the killer extended chase scene to conclude on a rather impressive bit of stuntwork for all performers. Great, pure entertainment from start to finish.   \n",

Two horror-focused knock-offs of The Abyss were already plenty of company, so leave it to <PERSON> to help usher in the threadbare variant to make it a crowd. Surprisingly, this winds up a lot more like <PERSON> film in a fairly significant way with the much friendlier underwater lifeforms that desire for humanity to be just a little bit nicer to each other and especially to the planet, but the comparisons end there as this boasts none of the spectacle or imagination that made <PERSON>'s film an unwieldy yet undeniably impressive effort all around. Instead, the film trades very heavily on scenes where <PERSON> kinda sorta trips out to sea spooge, with her direction in those scenes seemingly instructing her to use the full range of pained expressions on her face and little else, as she overacts her way into becoming the heroine of sorts of the film. At least she's trying, which is more than can be said of her co-stars, who are so wooden that they could have (and should have, really) been replaced with pieces of driftwood and no one would be any the wiser. The story is...well, I'm not sure it has one, scientifically speaking, as the cliches that it opts to mine from various sources (especially Alien for a bit) seem less like an arrangement of sequences organized around a singular premise and more a collection of scenes you expect from a film of this nature that can feel strangely disconnected from one another, making its 77 minute run time feel much, much longer than even the special edition of its chief source of inspiration. And with so much that it pilfers from elsewhere, the lack of originality becomes more and more of a liability as the film trudges along, resulting in a lot of scenes you've seen done far, far better elsewhere as the film struggles to circumvent the constraints of its meager budget and fails to make the grade at every important juncture. While it's not an unwatchable mess, per se, it is nevertheless a genuine struggle to get through it with getting very restless, especially as the choice to get more classy than the usual Concorde Pictures fare at the time leaves it absent of any trace of sleazy goodness and leaving the viewer scratching their head as to how this was deemed the direction to go in for the kind of money they were trying to chase down. I can't imagine it didn't make that money back at some point, but the deficiencies are so strong that it was assuredly a much tighter race to the finish line than they would have preferred. If only the finish line for the viewer was a lot closer, too!   \n",

For a franchise about how family unity can overcome amazing odds they don’t seem to mind dropping family members at the first sign of trouble or profit. They have now sent <PERSON> away to some kind of victim shaming program where they tell her that she is the problem. No one likes her and she’s on her own. It made me really sad to think about her dealing with all the shit in her life alone in a strange place. It comes off as cruel and unfair. The only person who is there for her is <PERSON> but he’s only partially involved because his main concerns are renovating the building, his new wife and teenage daughter.\\n\\nThe movie just stinks. There’s so much to hate on I don’t know where to start. I hate the victim shaming psychologist, I hate how they just did away with <PERSON>, I hate that they dropped the family for the chance to make another film and I hate that they tried to use <PERSON> again. Even though this film gets a ton of well deserved hate it does have a few redeeming qualities. The best and most interesting part of this film is how the building is used as an inescapable labyrinth filled with elevators, escalators, doors, windows, water, ice, mirrors, blank walls and long halls. The way they used those elements along with the reflection based scares led to some interesting effects and pretty enjoyable scenes. It creates a disturbing environment where the viewer never really knows where in the building they are. The characters go down two different elevators to get to a parking garage then they descend again into a mall area and then down again on escalators to finally arrive at the buildings lobby. It must have been built by the same architect that built the Overlook. Being trapped in a confusing and disturbing high rise while being able to see the safe normal world outside is a great place for a haunting/possession story. If this wasn’t a <PERSON> film I think I might have actually enjoyed it but it’s not. It’s a mean spirited half baked cash grab.   \n",

I can't wait to watch this film. I'm gonna put on a dirty shirt and take the day off of work.\\n\\nA Highschool senior discovers that he's actually <PERSON>! Two angels then attempt to find the recently reincarnated <PERSON> and stop him before he can bring hell to earth.\\n\\nWow, this was crazy fun. I'm still in shock. Death by dodgeball! Passion play crucifixion! That shower scene! Each minute of this film is better than the last.\\nThis is a pretty odd film and the pacing and structure are even odder. Everything feels a little off but it all works, or at least it did for me. The soundtrack is unbelievable. It's got the B52's, the Ramones, <PERSON>, The Sex Pistols, The Talking Heads and The Boomtown Rats. It's got ugly pale and washed out cinematography. But somehow that didn't completely piss me off or take away from the film at all. And the special effects! They look like the animation from She-Ra's transformation! Everything was so bad and great and unique. It completely enraptured me in its blurry glamour. I don't want to give the impression that this is a good film, it's not but it is unique, entertaining and an absolute blast.   \n",

For the sake of the sub, I'll say that I worked at a school that happened to have a classroom full of adult-aged fifth graders. They had the same maturity as 5th graders, learning 5th and 6th grade Math.\\n\\nAt \"Scrappy-Doo Charter School for Adults\", which actually happened to moonlight as a University of Phoenix campus, I got the upstairs corner office/classroom. I had two walls that were completely windows, 100 percent see through panes. It made it difficult in some ways (like not enough wall space), but overall it worked out. The students loved being able to look outside and see the entire neighborhood. When I say ALL windows, I mean ALL... I'm 6'2\", and from slightly above my knees all the way up to the ceiling it was see through panes of glass. It was gorgeous.\\n\\nDespite being a school that teaches \"Adult fifth graders\" and beyond, we had lockdown procedures that we practiced monthly. During a lockdown, all staff and students had to be \"below all outward-facing windows\" for the entire lockdown. I had the group of us sit criss-cross applesauce (which was fun to see with this group of Billy-Madison style giant fifth graders) and we took turns telling scary stories in a whisper.\\n\\nMy principal did NOT like this one bit. He burst in during our Mockdown and yelled at everybody, saying \"You have to be as low as possible so you don't DIE from a stray BULLET!\". Wow. Despite these kids being adults, they were still, in a sense, kids. Way to freak them out for next time, asshole.\\n\\n​\\n\\nAnyway, wouldn't you know it, a month and a half later something goes down at the \"Handler Mall\" where a domestic dispute turns into a kidnapping by gunpoint. The man took his former significant other around, right past our school. We went on lockdown quickly, and this time I was ready for some mighty fine MC.\\n\\n​\\n\\nWe got as low as possible. We all had pillows and blankets that I let them previously stash, brand new, in our closets in backup cubbies, and we all had nap time. Me included. I did not plan on laying down and actually sleeping, I just wanted to see the look on my principal's face when he saw a room full of manchildren having naptime during an actual emergency and lockdown. I got to see his face after hearing him bang on my door, which I somehow propped shut with a chair. His furious face made me so friggin happy. It's one of the best joys of my life, along with those \"kids\". They were all great.   \n",

One of our hottest sellers , besides our grilled chicken wraps , spicy chicken , and chili, is our potatoes.\\n\\nWell top them with whatever you want, they’re delicious, and they’re equally long to prepare. Like 55 minutes long. We try to prepare them ahead of time but so it takes us two cars in a row going on a potato run to wipe us out. That’s what happened this time. Whenever we get low we put more on, and sometimes microwave them from half done when needed.\\n\\nSometimes we’re unsure as to the quality of our potatoes , so we check to make sure they haven’t been waiting around too long and turn bad (they can get mushy or dark, just gross and unservable). That was also the case tonight. Every time we get a potato order through the drive thru we ask them to hold while we check to make sure we have good potatoes.\\n\\nSo grumpy mcCustomer swings by through our drive thru and I greet them “thanks for choosing Mendy’s how can I help you?”\\n\\nI get a very crotchety “I wanna potatoes and a bacon potatoes. Now!”\\n\\nI reply “sir let me check if we have them right now “.\\n\\nI turn to my manager “Bruce “, who is on the prep station because, yet again, somebody called in.\\n\\n<PERSON> heard the guy and began checking. The potatoes in the bin were bad , and right as I’m about to tell the guy no <PERSON> says “oh hold on “ and checks the oven. It was clear that we had potatoes at this point based on his thumbs up, and just as I’m about to tell the good news from mount potato I hear\\n\\n“Damn it azzhole you either do or you don’t!!!!! Tell me right now whether I have potatoes. !!!”\\n\\nEnter <PERSON>\\n\\nI replied instantly\\n\\n“You know what you’re right we either do or we don’t , and seeing where I can’t confirm or deny at this time I’d have to say that No, we don’t have potatoes right now. Sorry!!!!!”\\n\\nThe guy reply’s “well thanks for wearing my funking time azzhole!!”\\n\\n“Oh you’re welcome ….”\\n\\nSeriously , this guy was looking around at all the dirty crooks and the cheats of the world , when he could have been getting down to this. Sick. Beat.\\n\\nThe best part was <PERSON> holding up two potatoes as the guy drove by flipping us off. It was great seeing his angry brace change to bewilderment all the while. Loved it.\\n\\nOn a very unrelated side note, yes I also teach middle school and college This is my third gig if you don’t count tutoring. Just yesterday I stood my kids for the pledge and legit said “thanks for choosing <PERSON> , how can I help you. “. I guess so long as I don’t send my fry guy to detention.   \n",

I’m the main order taker at Mendys. “Listener extraordinaire “, if you will.\\n\\nI was smiling and excited as I wrote , proud papa beaming because my son moved up the football ranks to varsity, and varsity plays fridays. I understood how much this sucked because I usually have Wednesday off for the mrs and Thursdays off for my boys high school football games. Varsity plays Fridays. I knew I was gonna miss a lot of his games, but I figured I’d request off the last home have if the year, as it’s our district rival.\\n\\nBefore I could get a complete date scribbled my manager, “<PERSON>”, says “hey you can’t request off….” I looked at his face trying to see if he was joking. He wasn’t.\\n\\nEnter my first attempt at mc\\n\\nI said “really? It’s one day”\\n\\nHe then said as I tried to change my wording from request to inform (like “I won’t be in this day”) he said “you can’t call off either. Seriously, if u call me that day you’re no longer here”.\\n\\nEnter next MC\\n\\nDay of the rivalry game fast approaches , <PERSON> style, totally unexpected but expected all at once;\\n\\nI text in.\\n\\nI message <PERSON> “hey you said I couldn’t call you today so I’m texting. I won’t be in tonight. I also emailed you along with the division manager ccd in to remind you that Mendys has a policy that allows for requesting off many days in advance. My request was instantly denied three weeks before the game. Now I’m just reminding you that I won’t be there if you’re expecting me “\\n\\nI walked back in my next scheduled day and <PERSON> apologized profusely , saying “why didn’t you tell me ?….”\\n\\nLike I need a reason.   \n",

We’re dragging sixty percent of our kids through a Mesa family day in the fourth, listening to some hyped patriotic-for-the-sake-of-patriotism type music, walking gently thru a crowd of peers, and others. This crowd wasn’t elbow to elbow by any means, it was sparse enough for the WannaBeachBoys to throw tshirts into the crowd and have twenty-something’s have enough room to fill sprint to catch these things. Any kindergarten teacher will tell you that having a runway of space leads to trouble. That’s exactly what it did.\\n\\nSo tshirts start getting launched directly to pretty people and randomly in the air as far as <PERSON> can throw (26 yards). One lands equidistant where I’m standing (still) and <PERSON> the third.\\n\\nHe runs directly into me, hard, nearly hits my wife, so I use my core strength plus some Taichi to shoulder toss this guy wide right (sorry , <PERSON> ). The kid jumps up instantly , saying “hey watch where the f/— you’re going!!!!”\\n\\nHilarious. Time for some MC.\\n\\nThe next t shirt that comes <PERSON> way I make sure to run up right next to him, watching EXACTLY where I’m going. As it approaches I watch exactly where I’m going as I run hands up right for this guy, making sure to watch where I’m going, and making sure that the path I need to run is going his way. I make sure I tell him “hey I’m watching where I’m GOING!”, snag the shirt and toss it to a random kid.\\n\\nWhat’s this? What’s this? A humbled smelly mehhhhhhhhhhsss.\\n\\nAnyway , <PERSON> and his crew of crapfiends huddled up and whispered, and right when they all started to huddle up security stepped in (and probably saved my deductible ).\\n\\nI think we all grew a little that day.   \n",

I usually do drive thru, but here I am being asked to do a refund at the lobby register because I know how.\\n\\nA southern (like if <PERSON> played pickle ball or something) lady ordered four Baggy Bags (her words) with an extra frosty. All chocolate. Okay, cool. We make her all of her food, and last second she decides \"You know what? I don't want those they don't look chocolatey enough. Not at all!\"\\n\\nOkay, fine. We comply, and instead of making the lady give me the credit card to refund the full meal, then then ring her up for the meal without the frosties (about a fifty cent upcharge per) I simply ring up four medium frosties as a direct refund. This amount has her getting back 12.99.\\n\\nShe immediately complained and shouted \"HEY! Azzhat!! That's not the right amount of Frosties!! Enter the right amount of fu--ing frosties and don't cheap out on me!!\" This was roughly translated because it was a heated moment, but she mentioned something about me being cheap. Also,\\n\\nI Never been called an asshat for. I'm honored.\\n\\nI was about to explain that she was getting a refund that's worth half her meal, but the azzhat didn't sit right with me, and made the MC adjustment.\\n\\n\"You know what you're right, you had five frosties, the upcharges for the meals and then the extra one, right? Okay, let me fix that\"\\n\\n​\\n\\nI took a long time to \"figure out\" how to make the refund happen, which required me to take her card multiple times, and then show her that I refunded her for her one full price frosty at $2.13 and then four more frosties at 50 cents each, so it's $4.13 back to her.\\n\\n​\\n\\n\"Oh that can't be right!! \"\\n\\n​\\n\\nI told her just how wrong she was, showing her receipts as she realized what a mistake she made, as her food just kept getting as cold as My Frosty-Flavored Heart.\\n\\n​\\n\\nTLDR: Angry Chocolatier misses out on a 9 dollar discount.\\n\\nSorry because I\"m typing this hunched over instead of washing dishes rn.\\n\\n​   \n",

I was reading a story about dead fish and instantly got brought back to a story I had long since forgotten, back in the recesses of my withering mind. Back when I was a cashier for a large grocery store that is a homonym for my favorite food.\\n\\nI had plenty of experience in retail, as I previously worked at a cross town rival for many years. I found my self cashiering for a manager who perpetually treated me like an idiot, and despite being able to tell people their change before I punch in the total, he insists that I “stop showing off like a little asshole”. Um excuse me? I’m 6 2 280. I’m far from little. Anyway, this is really all unrelated except that he didn’t like me, repeatedly nsukted me, and watched me like a hawk.\\n\\nI was scanning groceries for some resting-confused-faced lady who looked at the screen after every scan as if she just arrived on the planet. I finally get to a stack of cat food cans that looks suspiciously stuck together. I used to stock groceries , and have seen this before; cat food cans damaged and get stuck together. My old boss said to scan if we CAN (his stupid joke lol ) and toss in the bin. That’s all the training I ever received.\\n\\nSo anyways Manager HatesTheWorld is bagging, the lady is looking like she’s studying the particles in the air, and I take the double can and put it off to the side to get ready to call for a replacement.\\n\\nBefore I could say a thing, the lady gets huffy and says to just “separate the cans , don’t be an idiot”. This got the attention of Manager <PERSON> as he says “you heard her, separate the cans!”\\n\\nOkay. YOU get some MC, You get some MC, Everybody’s going home today with some MC!\\n\\nI saw that the twocan was expired. I knew that this wasn’t going to be good. Even cat food cans that weren’t expired were gross when they got stuck together. I admittedly protested initially, but I was shut down pretty quickly, so I grabbed two plastic bags as gloves, opened the cans (A difficult task) and it literally popped as I pried it. The most disgusting looking, smelling zhit permeated the air. We shut down my lane. Confused lady is now grossed out lady covered In what used to be cat food. She just leaves. I run to the restroom to wash up, come out to see my manager cleaning up the mess with his head turned away.\\n\\n“What are you doing, help me!”\\n\\nOh I’m sorry, I’m highly reactive to horrible smells!” I reply.\\n\\nThis isn’t normally true , but for this particular smell, I just couldn’t. Knowing what botulism most likely was there, I suggested having them fill out a report and call some people, as per OSHA MSDS requirements.\\n\\nThings eventually got cleaned up, and valuable lessons about health and safety were learned by all that day\\n\\nSorry cuz mobile.   \n",

The mirror suggests universal symmetry yet none are the same. You see what you want. Yours is a world well worn, predetermined, a purgatorial state of unbecoming. Your venial faults and transgressions water you down to a vehicle of unsatiated hypothalamus. The gorgeous blonde is a psycho hose beast, lulling your weak instinct into greater depravity. She is the snake charmer who defiles, the succubus that controls your world without time, which leaves you unraveling at work as you laugh at daytime soaps. The \"wife material\" yells and beckons to your deaf ears, and your use by the blonde converges simultaneously into your use by others. The plan was never yours and that's a kind of Hell. A world perceived without freewill is maddening. The climb against temptation is grueling. The fall is easy. Alas, the consequences are cosmic.   \n",

Is it a good thing to \"take\" ideas? Is it all for nought that any idea that pops into our heads has, in some way, been thought of before? Is it an act of passion or a lack thereof that triggers this? Critics throw flowers at directors' feet when they \"pay homage\" yet they criticize and reduce films when they are \"too much\" like their influencers. Imitation is the highest form of flattery. I'm just as guilty as anyone else, making comparisons where I can throughout my cinematic journey. Humans also learn best through witnessing examples and enduring repetition. We improve upon what came before, or try, at least.\\n\\nClearly the 2010 film, Certified Copy, has lived rent free in my head since I viewed it months ago... Iranian director <PERSON> tried to limit watching cinema so he would refrain from copying and regurgitating material. The various levels in which we actively or passively retain influences is innumerably complex, bifurcating into tinier and tinier fragments/ideas/sources.\\n\\n<PERSON> work belongs in this discussion respectfully, as his influence to modern cinema is obvious, as well as where he took influence from. Dragon Inn is a one-location classic stacked with numerous stare-downs, as well as a handful of scenes with proper use of tension. These character interactions are direct ancestors to your modern day <PERSON> and <PERSON> as well as the more obvious contemporary martial arts film in say Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\\n\\nTwo of <PERSON> scenes in particular, both of which revolve around poisoned wine, are comedic vaudevillian masterclasses. There is a clear connection to <PERSON> or <PERSON> & <PERSON> slapstick, in order to not end up poisoned or walk away as the one with the bag of money in the end. The martial arts I've seen have lightly displayed this kind of magic but never really brought it to the forefront like in Dragon Inn.\\n\\nWhat aids the old school tactics is King <PERSON>'s camera, making what would be your typical swords film into something much more romantic; a simple yet lavish set, colorful costumes, warm horizons, and the relationships that come out of the proceedings. It naturally becomes an ode to a singular nomadic lifestyle, in nature, away from political warmongering and the like. The plot also harbors a sense of family and togetherness as the Yu Clan kids are in danger of capture from a General.\\n\\nCan't say this is better than Come Drink With Me as they both have unique qualities I admire. It was much easier for me to pick up on where <PERSON>'s influences came from this go-around, and I'm excited to see how that changes if at all as I go deeper into the mix.   \n",

First time she hopped on a register because she thought she was a cashier or could get away without bagging. Second time she went and complained that she was hired as a cashier not a bagger and it's too hard bagging for the amount of time a bagger is scheduled for. So management told her she'd only be scheduled as a cashier. She still bags but only when it's \"convenient\" for her\\n\\nI recently started dialysis for CKD and my arm really hurts after my session so I said when needed I don't want to bag to give my arm a break and what not. I only bag when it doesn't trigger the pain in my arm (feels like my arm is being squeezed really really hard) at times because of the needles and since I'm new to the dialysis scene.\\n\\n<PERSON> did not like that so she tried to complain that it wasn't fair I didn't have to bag. She was met with due to medical reasons they are allowing this to happen\\n\\nShe said in earshot that if you can't do the job you're scheduled to do then you shouldn't be working. I so wanted to laugh out loud at that but I stayed quiet and rolled my eyes out of view\\n\\nI've been wanting to say to her \"Why the hell are you complaining about me not having to bag when you yourself went and complained about being scheduled as a bagger and got your way?\"\\n\\nLike don't go getting your way about something then complain because I don't have to do the same thing!   \n",

I watch as people walk past my coworker(s) standing at their registers waiting for a customer to come to mine and my lights not on yet nor am I logged on. It's like GO TO ONE OF MY COWORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN HERE FOR A LITTLE BIT AND ARE READY. These are not regulars here too see me they're just dumbass customers who go \"oh let's go to the register with the cashier not ready durrr\"\\n\\nThroughout the day customers will literally do the ignore my coworkers with no customers to stand behind a customer I'm already helping them they act dumb when they say they didn't see my coworker (these are the customers who also think that if they see me helping a customer already that I'm the only cashier). DUDE! from all directions people come from to walk to the register I can clearly see which register(s) are open don't pretend that you don't\\n\\nThere are times where my coworkers will only have 1 customer in their line while I have like 5.\\n\\nIt's annoying and irritating   \n",

You're welcome.\\n\\nSome people rag on Casino for being a ripoff of <PERSON>'s widely lauded 1990 classic, Goodfellas. And yes, the similarities are pretty clear. Both are brilliant 90s gangster films exploring similar themes, stories & characters, Both have the inimitable style and suave we've all come to expect from <PERSON>. Same screenwriters, very similar cast - <PERSON> typecast as pretty much the same murdering looney - you get the idea.\\n\\nBut I'm gonna go out on a limb with a spicy hot-take that Casino is better than Goodfellas, and my reasoning is simple enough: the performances. Given, performances are a strong point in Goodfellas; <PERSON> and <PERSON> are phenomenal. But, I don’t think anyone in Goodfellas touches <PERSON> and <PERSON> in Casino (not to mention <PERSON> is still very good). I also think that Casino has a more succinct and defined storyline, whereas Goodfellas is pretty much a bunch of gangsters hangin out, shootin the shit and doing crazy stuff. Don’t get me wrong, still hilariously entertaining, I just prefer the former.\\n\\nAnyways, it doesn’t really matter which one is better; they’re both fantastic films by a world-class storyteller. Maybe Casino is better from a pure entertainment standpoint while Goodfellas is a more charming technical marvel. Who cares?\\n\\nEither way, go watch it on Netflix before it’s gone, especially if you haven’t seen it.\\n\\n'Scorsese - Ranked' |||| 'Favorite Movies of All Time'   \n",

I think that the issue lies primarily with the screenplay.\\n\\nAll of the characters seem one note and there isn't any real conflict. Even the crux of the story between <PERSON> and his wife doesn't have a lot of emotion or depth, IMO. I didn't gain much insight into the people or events involved (besides the fact that <PERSON> was an asshole). Because of these issues, the emotional backbone of the story didn't land for me.\\n\\nBesides all that, First Man is a technical marvel. The cinematography, special effects, sound design, and direction of the action sequences are all incredibly well done. I loved the claustrophobic feel to all the scenes in the shuttle; it really gives you a perspective of what the astronauts were experiencing. The entire moon landing scene is excellent.\\n\\nOverall, First Man is good but the whole film is not greater than the sum of its parts. It had a lot of promise and great talent involved, which is probably why I left the theater feeling a bit let down.\\n\\nAdded to ‘2018 - Ranked’ and ‘Movies seen in theaters - Ranked'   \n",

He's always been great at writing enigmatic, self-possessed female characters who usually have some kind of silent torment brewing underneath their surface.\\n\\n<PERSON> & <PERSON>, the two central characters, start off as two icy strangers merely tolerating each other’s presence, and transform into a dynamic duo on the run, revealed as two unhappy women hoping to escape their circumstances. They become united by one enemy – <PERSON>’s boss and <PERSON>’s (ex) lover. This enemy has exploited them both in different ways – he undervalues <PERSON>’s labour & generally treats her poorly, and he romantically & emotionally mistreats <PERSON>.\\n\\nIt takes place on the day of <PERSON> death, so his songs are often playing wherever they go, as if death/danger/threat is always looming over them. A sense of urgency is established in the very first scene where we see two hands doing a tense dance around a map on the table. The idea of transience is central too, like the way <PERSON> keeps her life in Germany rootless (living in hotels or her car) because she yearns to escape it.\\n\\nThe last 15-20mins of this really stand out and you can appreciate the dynamic <PERSON> has subtly established between the two women. I always prefer when writers establish their characters by having them interact with each other instead of having them react to external things that can often bloat the narrative.\\n\\nA welcome addition to the Thelma & Louise/Bonnie & Clyde \"Lovers on the Run\" genre.   \n",

I felt like there was always double of everything\\n\\nPan is an absolute delight and really reminds me why i love the medium of film to tell stories.\\n\\n<PERSON> creates a two and a half minute cocoon of clips and images about her identity and upbringing as someone who is half Japanese & half Venezuelan. She talks about the similarities between the Spanish and Japanese language (\"Pan\" means \"bread\" in both), and how she learned that you don't have to try and define yourself as just one thing, or fit just one box. Accepting the \"in between\" is a gatway to self-discovery.\\n\\nAll the parts of this come together to create something so serene and comforting. It took me on a short little emotional journey that i wasn't prepared for lol\\n\\nWATCH HERE!!!! IT RULES!!!!   \n",

Watching her in this felt like you're watching someone completely give in to their character. She makes this film what it is – a haunting story about the horrors of confronting yourself.\\n\\nThere's a scene, probably my favourite from the film, of her and <PERSON> in a dark room in bed and the way it's lit and the way the oranges and yellows of both their clothing and hair play against the darkness behind them results in something so arresting and visceral.\\n\\nNot to mention the depths explored in regards to suicide, loneliness, anxiety – both in the existential sense and the psychological sense (but mostly the former).\\n\\nThere are so many supernatural elements in this that are portrayed in such a literal sense and it really works for making personal & ineffable feelings/experiences less abstract, and more universal. The scenes felt purely emotive to me.\\n\\nAlso <PERSON> wrote this to the cast and crew before they started working on it:\\n\\n\"If some honest person were to ask me honestly just why I have written this film, I, to be honest, could not give a clear cut answer.

I want to go home to bed. There's absolutely nothing wrong with me.\"\\nOften lauded as <PERSON> best performance, and i can see why. Watching her in this felt like you're watching someone completely give in to their character. She makes this film what it is – a haunting story about the horrors of confronting yourself.\\n\\nThere's a scene, probably my favourite from the film, of her and <PERSON> in a dark room in bed and the way it's lit and the way the oranges and yellows of both their clothing and hair play against the darkness behind them results in something so arresting and visceral.\\n\\nNot to mention the depths explored in regards to suicide, loneliness, anxiety – both in the existential sense and the psychological sense (but mostly the former).\\n\\nThere are so many supernatural elements in this that are portrayed in such a literal sense and it really works for making personal & ineffable feelings/experiences less abstract, and more universal. The scenes felt purely emotive to me.\\n\\nAlso <PERSON> wrote this to the cast and crew before they started working on it:\\n\\n\"If some honest person were to ask me honestly just why I have written this film, I, to be honest, could not give a clear cut answer. I think that for some time now I have been living with an anxiety which has had no tangible cause....

Enter <PERSON>, a mysterious character who hires <PERSON> to find a missing white woman. What <PERSON> initially thinks would be some easy money spirals into a chaotic experience laced with twists, murder, and of course, a devil in a blue dress.\\n\\nThis film does a great job incorporating film noir elements. It's a genre I've only seen a handful of films from, but I can definitely tell that any recognizable noirish elements fit perfectly in this film. The story is gripping not only due to a rich, twist filled, suspense filled, thrill a minute story, but because of a colorful cast of characters headed by <PERSON>. <PERSON> is great as always and does an excellent job transforming from reluctant hero to badass detective, but it's <PERSON> who undeniably steals the show. While <PERSON> brings the charm, <PERSON> brings the crazy and his character is so much fun to watch. Him and <PERSON> also share some fantastic chemistry the more you see their unique friendship; almost a brotherly bond of sorts. <PERSON> brings class and elegance to a femme fatale like role. She has her own instantly likable charm to her, but also a crafty, shady side of her own. You see why her character can win so many people over in the film despite their better judgements. Then there's <PERSON> whose sinister eyes mixed with a slimy, dangerous exterior makes for a damn good antagonist.\\n\\nI only had two problems with the film and they were more personal problems that actual problems with the film. The first is the narration. I get it's a film noir trope, but I've never liked narration. I don't like being told stuff that I'm already seeing or I can figure out myself. There's one scene where it works effectively, but that's it for me. Maybe it'll grow on me the more I watch this. And the other problem is that the movie left me wanting more. It's not a bad ending--great ending--but you can tell they set up an Easy Rawlins franchise we never got and it's so disappointing when you think about what could've been. I would've loved seeing countless Easy Rawlins sequels. But knowing we didn't get it--to loosely quote something <PERSON> said on his <PERSON> podcast--it's like watching a <PERSON> origin story end as soon as <PERSON> puts on the cowl for the first time.\\n\\nDespite those minor things, I kind of loved Devil in a Blue Dress and it's still pretty high on not only my list of favorite <PERSON> features (probably my 2nd fave <PERSON> film), but favorite films PERIOD.\\n\\nAnd again, if you do end up watching (or rewatching) this, make sure to turn the color down on your tv/computer. Looks way better that way; like a true blue film noir.   \n",

But as someone whose only seen a small handful of his work (The Great Dictator, City Lights, and most recently, Modern Times), the thought never crossed my mind until now. Now, after seeing a much older <PERSON> craft Limelight, I'm now forced to think about the greater significance and mastery of <PERSON>.\\n\\nThis semi-biographical tale stars <PERSON> as <PERSON>, a washed up comedian and stage actor who starts taking care of a suicidal ballerina (<PERSON>) after saving her life.\\n\\nThis is the most experienced and confident I've seen <PERSON> on screen and with greater age, he's improved after already being a masterful entertainer. As always, <PERSON> wrote, directed, and starred in this film and in all departments, he just makes it all look so easy. As an actor, he puts the utmost passion into his performance whether he tries to make you laugh or pull at your heartstrings. As a writer, he crafts a very poignant and tight story; even if it does run a little longer than it needs to. And in the director's chair, he's a master manipulator when it comes to packing emotional punches into his audience. He just gets it. He knows exactly what his audience wants, he knows how to make them laugh, and he knows how to break their hearts. And it works with flying colors every time.\\n\\nThe only issues I had with the film were that some of the on-stage performances ran so long that they slowed the film down for me and <PERSON> performance is a bit too melodramatic for my liking. Even then, these aren't major issues in that they didn't detract too much from my enjoyment of the film. <PERSON> is still working at his very best at this point in his career and while I wouldn't call this his very best film, it sits proudly among some of his most classic films if one were to rank them.\\n\\nIt's funny, it's endearing, it's hopeful, it's heartbreaking...it's <PERSON> and no one did it better.   \n",

The film's stripped down approache and the super fluid narrative makes up a pretty simple yet compelling watch.\\n\\nThe main focal point of this film is how multi-faceted each student is, and how their pov is different from each other. The main character of Annie is perhaps the professional victim of the head professor's own personal prejudice against him. The casual approach which the authorities carry out their official duties, and many such aspects of the student's life is shown with great details. Also the rebellious and woke undertones that this film carries throughout, until the end is very interesting and introspective to look at.   \n",

A revolutionary of all sorts, a trait that I've always admired in filmmakers, and watching my first <PERSON> on the big screen is a dream come true. A strictly dialogue oriented cinema which is cruel to witness as how <PERSON> makes the audiences helpless.\\n\\nA film that starts off as a conflict of interests between a producer, who can be called as a narcissistic man and the director regarding how the realized film should look. This debate eventually sees the entry of a new screenwriter who has to edit certain scenes according to the producer. This creates a domestic rift between the screenwriter and his wife (<PERSON>).\\n\\nWhat's fascinating to me is how much this film relies on the interactions between <PERSON> and <PERSON>. <PERSON>'s way of improvising is way more austere, and sometimes feels cruel as back and forth between the couple feels more sinister which gradually spirals into a much bigger problem. <PERSON> brilliant sense of space helps this film as <PERSON> incorporates the spaces between the apartment to signify the fall of the couple's marriage.\\n\\nContempt is a word which literally translates to \"the feeling that a person or a thing is worthless or beneath consideration.\"\\n\\nThis sneaky feeling is what makes the film more interesting as it's the character of <PERSON> is the one who gets this sensation and thus the well established love slowly fades. We see how much the character of <PERSON> played by <PERSON> feels like a pawn for her husband who uses her to please the producer.\\n\\nBut it's the swing of the power dynamics as ggradually the character of <PERSON> see how much detached <PERSON> really has become. The regret is instantaneous.\\n\\nThe final half of the film features primarily long shots with beautiful color compositional passages as the distance is significant to make us realize the irreparable drift that the married and love life of <PERSON> has taken the form off.\\n\\n<PERSON> has crafted a film that can be interpreted from different povs. The architectural design, the color pallette, screenplay, the future and past events that intercuts the continuity of the film, each and every movement by the characters makes for an excellent practice of impressionistic masterclass of acting and directing, and other technical aspects of filmmaking.   \n",

That's what we get to see here and I LOVED IT.\\n\\nWe see everything through <PERSON> unprejudiced eyes: from pleasure, to relationships, to control, and toxicity, and the way some men view and desire women and why, to work and self-reliance, to daddy issues, and money, and empathy, and guilt... EVERYTHING. And it was the most fun and refreshing journey ever, filled with unique characters and hilariously deep dialogue that I will never forget.\\n\\nI feel like <PERSON> always sits down about to write a script and goes: \"WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF...\" and then produces the most primal, deconstructed, insanely original story that's not fully rooted in reality but it's also somehow very pragmatic and also idealistic at the same time???\\n\\nIt's just genius, and the epitome of film innovation imo.\\nHis existence makes me excited for movies.\\nCan't wait to see what he'll do next.\\n\\nAlso <PERSON> performance was an experience on its own and I LOVED <PERSON> in this.\\n\\n—\\n\\nES\\n\\nImaginen re-experimentar y re-aprender el mundo a través de una mirada sin prejuicios y altamente lógica que solo se podría conseguir despojándola de todo conocimiento preconcebido y todo constructo social y prácticamente volviendo a nacer, en un cuerpo que definitivamente va a estar expuesto a todo lo peor y todo lo mejor de este mundo, además. Eso es lo que vemos en esta película Y ME ENCANTÓ.\\n\\nVemos todo a través de los ojos imparciales de Bella Baxter: desde el placer, hasta las relaciones, el control, la toxicidad, la forma en la que algunos hombres ven y desean a las mujeres y por qué, el trabajo, la autosuficiencia, los daddy issues, el dinero, la empatía, la culpa... TODO. Y fue el viaje más divertido y refrescante de la vida, lleno de personajes súper únicos y diálogos graciosamente profundos que nunca voy a olvidar.\\n\\nSiento que <PERSON> siempre se sienta a escribir un guión y dice tipo: \"QUE PASARÍA SI...\" y termina creando la historia más elemental, deconstruida y ridículamente original que no está completamente arraigada en la realidad pero de alguna manera también es súper pragmática y al mismo tiempo idealista???\\n\\nEs una genialidad y el epítome de innovación en el cine, en mi opinión.\\nSu existencia me hace emocionarme por las películas.\\nY no puedo esperar a ver qué va a hacer en el futuro.\\n\\nTambién la actuación de <PERSON> fue una experiencia por sí sola y AMÉ a <PERSON> en esta peli.   \n",

He wasn’t.\\n\\nEnter my first attempt at mc\\n\\nI said “really? It’s one day”\\n\\nHe then said as I tried to change my wording from request to inform (like “I won’t be in this day”) he said “you can’t call off either. Seriously, if u call me that day you’re no longer here”.\\n\\nEnter next MC\\n\\nDay of the rivalry game fast approaches , <PERSON> style, totally unexpected but expected all at once;\\n\\nI text in.\\n\\nI message <PERSON> “hey you said I couldn’t call you today so I’m texting. I won’t be in tonight. I also emailed you along with the division manager ccd in to remind you that Mendys has a policy that allows for requesting off many days in advance. My request was instantly denied three weeks before the game. Now I’m just reminding you that I won’t be there if you’re expecting me “\\n\\nI walked back in my next scheduled day and <PERSON> apologized profusely , saying “why didn’t you tell me ?….”\\n\\nLike I need a reason.   \n",

It could reasonably assumed based on the trees and New York location that this movie ends sometime around early to mid September. I know I’m just over analyzing this but that means either:\\n\\nA. This film ends less than a week before 9/11, and symbolically may be one of the bleakest endings ever made.\\n\\nB. This film ends directly after 9/11 and the ending which is just completely skipped over and the ending is even more hopeful than it seems?!?   \n",

Passionate and deed-based, yet unfocused, individualistic, and most importantly focused on the liberation of the consumer rather than the worker. Consumption of product under the guise of doing something more worthwhile, is at the heart of Falling Down, from the very first scene the toothy snarl of a <PERSON> plushy sets off “D-fens’s” rage, causing him to skip work for that day, instead starting and unhinged consumer revolution, holding up fast food stores and bodegas, using threats of violence as leverage for enhanced convenience. Although he still seems “countercultural” and on the side of the people, this focus on the consumer is in reality inherently anti-revolutionary, screwing over those who make the products even more. <PERSON> does an excellent job at portraying the misguided revolutionary in this biting and sardonic satire.   \n",

And I think the story was very well executed. <PERSON>'s character's whole \"breaking bad\" was more nuanced than I expected it to be and the way it all unfolds was very believable to me. It was just a solid villain origin story imo. And the film itself is pretty entertaining which is a big bonus.\\n\\nAlso I was worried about all the singing but it wasn't cringe. It was fitting I guess.\\n\\nSame Hunger Games vibe but vintage, and it was super interesting to watch how the games started and how they evolved into what we know them as. This is the only book I never read from the series and I left the cinema dying to read it so...\\n\\nPretty great.\\n\\n—\\n\\nES\\n\\nGratamente sorprendida con esta película.\\n\\nLa disfruté mucho más de lo que pensé que la iba a disfrutar. Y pienso que la historia estuvo muy bien ejecutada. Todo el proceso de <PERSON> volviéndose malo tuvo más capas y profundidad de lo que yo esperaba, y la forma en la que se desarrolló todo fue súper creíble para mi. Me pareció una villain origin story bastante sólida. Y la película como tal es súper entretenida, que es un gran bonus.\\n\\nMe preocupaba un poco toda la cantadera pero no fue nada cringe. Quedababa bien.\\n\\nEs la misma vibra de The Hunger Games pero vintage, y fue súper interesante ver cómo los juegos empezaron y cómo evolucionaron hasta ser lo que nosotros conocemos. Este es el único libro de la serie que nunca leí y salí del cine muriendo por leerlo así que...\\n\\nBastante genial.   \n",

That's what we get to see here and I LOVED IT.\\n\\nWe see everything through <PERSON> unprejudiced eyes: from pleasure, to relationships, to control, and toxicity, and the way some men view and desire women and why, to work and self-reliance, to daddy issues, and money, and empathy, and guilt... EVERYTHING. And it was the most fun and refreshing journey ever, filled with unique characters and hilariously deep dialogue that I will never forget.\\n\\nI feel like <PERSON> always sits down about to write a script and goes: \"WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF...\" and then produces the most primal, deconstructed, insanely original story that's not fully rooted in reality but it's also somehow very pragmatic and also idealistic at the same time???\\n\\nIt's just genius, and the epitome of film innovation imo.\\nHis existence makes me excited for movies.\\nCan't wait to see what he'll do next.\\n\\nAlso <PERSON> performance was an experience on its own and I LOVED <PERSON> in this.\\n\\n—\\n\\nES\\n\\nImaginen re-experimentar y re-aprender el mundo a través de una mirada sin prejuicios y altamente lógica que solo se podría conseguir despojándola de todo conocimiento preconcebido y todo constructo social y prácticamente volviendo a nacer, en un cuerpo que definitivamente va a estar expuesto a todo lo peor y todo lo mejor de este mundo, además. Eso es lo que vemos en esta película Y ME ENCANTÓ.\\n\\nVemos todo a través de los ojos imparciales de Bella Baxter: desde el placer, hasta las relaciones, el control, la toxicidad, la forma en la que algunos hombres ven y desean a las mujeres y por qué, el trabajo, la autosuficiencia, los daddy issues, el dinero, la empatía, la culpa... TODO. Y fue el viaje más divertido y refrescante de la vida, lleno de personajes súper únicos y diálogos graciosamente profundos que nunca voy a olvidar.\\n\\nSiento que <PERSON> siempre se sienta a escribir un guión y dice tipo: \"QUE PASARÍA SI...\" y termina creando la historia más elemental, deconstruida y ridículamente original que no está completamente arraigada en la realidad pero de alguna manera también es súper pragmática y al mismo tiempo idealista???\\n\\nEs una genialidad y el epítome de innovación en el cine, en mi opinión.\\nSu existencia me hace emocionarme por las películas.\\nY no puedo esperar a ver qué va a hacer en el futuro.\\n\\nTambién la actuación de <PERSON> fue una experiencia por sí sola y AMÉ a <PERSON> en esta peli.   \n",

An interesting set of situations and characters, but that is not too different from many other of that kind. The presence of <PERSON> shows once again that she is one of the most interesting females of her generation. I liked what I saw, but I always demanded more of what <PERSON> had for me. There are quite honest moments on an emotional level, but the feeling that it's just another medium movie, from a medium 2017, with no big surprises overall.   \n",

But Mother!, clearly inspired by the state of the world today, ends most of the time by becoming confused and overly bizarre, instead of creating a certain subtlety in the messages, throwing us all over the place at the same time.\\n\\nThe maternal side, and as the title indicates, is perhaps the greatest aspect to be explored, and creation the focal point of history. Not only the mother as a physical figure, but also mother nature, the person who creates life, whose love has to be respected because it is unique and irreplaceable. Humanity is obsessed with less important things, not attaching to the most significant details, letting appearances follow a path of self-destruction. It may be unique, or we would not be talking about <PERSON>, and I even realize where he wants to get, but the way he chooses to come up with the biggest metaphor of them all becomes too bizarre and tiring to watch, especially the last half an hour of film. However, the paradoxes between past and modern times, where social criticism, on gender equality issues and the desire to achieve fame, are connected to obsessional thirst to idolize the famous pseudo-figures for no apparent reason. The religious component is also very strong, as is the picture of the present world, uncontrolled and unthinking.\\n\\nWhen I give negative to the film, I think at the same time of the importance of what <PERSON> wants to do with this work. It's a mixture of feelings. While one side of me wants to give him credit, another thinks that the extreme difference that characterizes him is worthy of prominence, and probably will be one of those that will provoke varied discussions about what is visualized.   \n",

At <DATE_TIME> with his older brothers away at war and his father ill, <PERSON> had to leave school to run the farm. He returned to school when the situation stabilized. <PERSON> left school again as a senior to join the Army as the Korean Conflict was escalating. He was awarded a GED from Jordan High School. He was a dedicated soldier and received high security clearance as a radio operator. <PERSON> was honorably discharged in <DATE_TIME>.

His talents also touched the homes of numerous family members and friends. <PERSON> lived but the motto “measure twice, cut once” but there may have been a slip-up here and there! No matter what project he was working on, you could be sure he’d have trouble marking his measurements. That’s because <PERSON> was constantly looking for his carpenter’s pencil.\\n\\nAnd as they say, you can take the boy out of the country but you can’t take the country out of the boy. <PERSON> was living proof of that. <PERSON>, <PERSON> and <PERSON> knew that <DATE_TIME> meant <PERSON> and <PERSON> would be going to “the farm”, usually <PERSON>’s but sometimes <PERSON>’s. And it better not rain <DATE_TIME>, as there was visible disappointment. <PERSON> was certain that sometimes <PERSON> was more concerned about the farm than the owners were!\\n\\n<PERSON> loved being a husband, father, grandpa and great-grandpa. He was always there to lend a helping hand when someone needed it, but he’d never ask for anything in return. He was a quiet leader and set a wonderful example for his family.   \n",

It´s an unrelentingly heartbreaking journey following a 12-year-old boy who has to look after himself and his three younger half-siblings (every child has a different father) after their mother abandoned them. <PERSON> grounded, naturalistic filmmaking approach eschews any kind of melodrama as we follow the daily struggles of the children in a string of immersive, involving slice of life vignettes. <PERSON> the fictional storyteller and <PERSON> the documentarian once again blend together to ultimately serve <PERSON>-eda the humanist. He portrays the suffering with great tenderness and finds beauty and hope in the unbreakable bond and unwavering spirit of the siblings. Speaking of the children, the young cast is phenomenal. In every scene, they´re natural and believable. In particular <PERSON> deserves to be mentioned when we talk about all-time great child actor performances. “Nobody Knows” is a delicate, subtle, and well-crafted slice of life family drama that elicits strong emotions. I felt the long runtime, the middle part kind of blurs together in my memory, and other <PERSON>-eda films ultimately gave me more to think about but on a purely empathetic level, it doesn´t get much rawer and more impactful than this movie.   \n",

You can see it as a cool, laid-back American answer to “El Topo”. The film is a pleasantly hypnotizing experience thanks to <PERSON> monochrome cinematography, <PERSON> guitar score, the meditative tone, the allegorical images, the poetic dialogue, the deadpan humor, and the surreal, bizarre narrative. Furthermore, <PERSON> and <PERSON> make up one of the western genre´s most eccentric and memorable leading duos, and they are supported by an all-star cast. All in all, “Dead Man” is a unique and mesmerizing western mood piece and a top-tier <PERSON> film.   \n",

Nothing terribly fancy from a story perspective, as everything is in service for the many, many gags on display here, but the nimble versatility of the scenario suits <PERSON>'s talents quite well in the early goings as perhaps the worst waiter in the world with the best luck as the Tramp's vindictive behaviors makes for a barrage of very funny jokes that almost makes you wonder just how much the film needed to change settings to the roller rink in the end. When it does finally arrive, though, you're very thankful that it did as <PERSON> on skates is quite a sight to behold for his remarkable form that makes even the pratfalls (often not his own, I might add!) look as graceful as the more expert maneuvers he pulls off, well before chaos reigns once more in a cacophony of collisions that spurs the killer extended chase scene to conclude on a rather impressive bit of stuntwork for all performers. Great, pure entertainment from start to finish.   \n",

Two horror-focused knock-offs of The Abyss were already plenty of company, so leave it to <PERSON> to help usher in the threadbare variant to make it a crowd. Surprisingly, this winds up a lot more like <PERSON> film in a fairly significant way with the much friendlier underwater lifeforms that desire for humanity to be just a little bit nicer to each other and especially to the planet, but the comparisons end there as this boasts none of the spectacle or imagination that made <PERSON>'s film an unwieldy yet undeniably impressive effort all around. Instead, the film trades very heavily on scenes where <PERSON> kinda sorta trips out to sea spooge, with her direction in those scenes seemingly instructing her to use the full range of pained expressions on her face and little else, as she overacts her way into becoming the heroine of sorts of the film. At least she's trying, which is more than can be said of her co-stars, who are so wooden that they could have (and should have, really) been replaced with pieces of driftwood and no one would be any the wiser. The story is...well, I'm not sure it has one, scientifically speaking, as the cliches that it opts to mine from various sources (especially Alien for a bit) seem less like an arrangement of sequences organized around a singular premise and more a collection of scenes you expect from a film of this nature that can feel strangely disconnected from one another, making its 77 minute run time feel much, much longer than even the special edition of its chief source of inspiration. And with so much that it pilfers from elsewhere, the lack of originality becomes more and more of a liability as the film trudges along, resulting in a lot of scenes you've seen done far, far better elsewhere as the film struggles to circumvent the constraints of its meager budget and fails to make the grade at every important juncture. While it's not an unwatchable mess, per se, it is nevertheless a genuine struggle to get through it with getting very restless, especially as the choice to get more classy than the usual Concorde Pictures fare at the time leaves it absent of any trace of sleazy goodness and leaving the viewer scratching their head as to how this was deemed the direction to go in for the kind of money they were trying to chase down. I can't imagine it didn't make that money back at some point, but the deficiencies are so strong that it was assuredly a much tighter race to the finish line than they would have preferred. If only the finish line for the viewer was a lot closer, too!   \n",

I can't wait to watch this film. I'm gonna put on a dirty shirt and take the day off of work.\\n\\nA Highschool senior discovers that he's actually <PERSON>! Two angels then attempt to find the recently reincarnated <PERSON> and stop him before he can bring hell to earth.\\n\\nWow, this was crazy fun. I'm still in shock. Death by dodgeball! Passion play crucifixion! That shower scene! Each minute of this film is better than the last.\\nThis is a pretty odd film and the pacing and structure are even odder. Everything feels a little off but it all works, or at least it did for me. The soundtrack is unbelievable. It's got the B52's, the Ramones, <PERSON>, The Sex Pistols, The Talking Heads and The Boomtown Rats. It's got ugly pale and washed out cinematography. But somehow that didn't completely piss me off or take away from the film at all. And the special effects! They look like the animation from She-Ra's transformation! Everything was so bad and great and unique. It completely enraptured me in its blurry glamour. I don't want to give the impression that this is a good film, it's not but it is unique, entertaining and an absolute blast.   \n",

For a franchise about how family unity can overcome amazing odds they don’t seem to mind dropping family members at the first sign of trouble or profit. They have now sent <PERSON> away to some kind of victim shaming program where they tell her that she is the problem. No one likes her and she’s on her own. It made me really sad to think about her dealing with all the shit in her life alone in a strange place. It comes off as cruel and unfair. The only person who is there for her is <PERSON> but he’s only partially involved because his main concerns are renovating the building, his new wife and teenage daughter.\\n\\nThe movie just stinks. There’s so much to hate on I don’t know where to start. I hate the victim shaming psychologist, I hate how they just did away with <PERSON>, I hate that they dropped the family for the chance to make another film and I hate that they tried to use <PERSON> again. Even though this film gets a ton of well deserved hate it does have a few redeeming qualities. The best and most interesting part of this film is how the building is used as an inescapable labyrinth filled with elevators, escalators, doors, windows, water, ice, mirrors, blank walls and long halls. The way they used those elements along with the reflection based scares led to some interesting effects and pretty enjoyable scenes. It creates a disturbing environment where the viewer never really knows where in the building they are. The characters go down two different elevators to get to a parking garage then they descend again into a mall area and then down again on escalators to finally arrive at the buildings lobby. It must have been built by the same architect that built the Overlook. Being trapped in a confusing and disturbing high rise while being able to see the safe normal world outside is a great place for a haunting/possession story. If this wasn’t a <PERSON> film I think I might have actually enjoyed it but it’s not. It’s a mean spirited half baked cash grab.   \n",

I was reading a story about dead fish and instantly got brought back to a story I had long since forgotten, back in the recesses of my withering mind. Back when I was a cashier for a large grocery store that is a homonym for my favorite food.\\n\\nI had plenty of experience in retail, as I previously worked at a cross town rival for many years. I found my self cashiering for a manager who perpetually treated me like an idiot, and despite being able to tell people their change before I punch in the total, he insists that I “stop showing off like a little asshole”. Um excuse me? I’m 6 2 280. I’m far from little. Anyway, this is really all unrelated except that he didn’t like me, repeatedly nsukted me, and watched me like a hawk.\\n\\nI was scanning groceries for some resting-confused-faced lady who looked at the screen after every scan as if she just arrived on the planet. I finally get to a stack of cat food cans that looks suspiciously stuck together. I used to stock groceries , and have seen this before; cat food cans damaged and get stuck together. My old boss said to scan if we CAN (his stupid joke lol ) and toss in the bin. That’s all the training I ever received.\\n\\nSo anyways Manager HatesTheWorld is bagging, the lady is looking like she’s studying the particles in the air, and I take the double can and put it off to the side to get ready to call for a replacement.\\n\\nBefore I could say a thing, the lady gets huffy and says to just “separate the cans , don’t be an idiot”. This got the attention of Manager <PERSON> as he says “you heard her, separate the cans!”\\n\\nOkay. YOU get some MC, You get some MC, Everybody’s going home today with some MC!\\n\\nI saw that the twocan was expired. I knew that this wasn’t going to be good. Even cat food cans that weren’t expired were gross when they got stuck together. I admittedly protested initially, but I was shut down pretty quickly, so I grabbed two plastic bags as gloves, opened the cans (A difficult task) and it literally popped as I pried it. The most disgusting looking, smelling zhit permeated the air. We shut down my lane. Confused lady is now grossed out lady covered In what used to be cat food. She just leaves. I run to the restroom to wash up, come out to see my manager cleaning up the mess with his head turned away.\\n\\n“What are you doing, help me!”\\n\\nOh I’m sorry, I’m highly reactive to horrible smells!” I reply.\\n\\nThis isn’t normally true , but for this particular smell, I just couldn’t. Knowing what botulism most likely was there, I suggested having them fill out a report and call some people, as per OSHA MSDS requirements.\\n\\nThings eventually got cleaned up, and valuable lessons about health and safety were learned by all that day\\n\\nSorry cuz mobile.   \n",

I’m the main order taker at Mendys. “Listener extraordinaire “, if you will.\\n\\nI was smiling and excited as I wrote , proud papa beaming because my son moved up the football ranks to varsity, and varsity plays fridays. I understood how much this sucked because I usually have Wednesday off for the mrs and Thursdays off for my boys high school football games. Varsity plays Fridays. I knew I was gonna miss a lot of his games, but I figured I’d request off the last home have if the year, as it’s our district rival.\\n\\nBefore I could get a complete date scribbled my manager, “<PERSON>”, says “hey you can’t request off….” I looked at his face trying to see if he was joking. He wasn’t.\\n\\nEnter my first attempt at mc\\n\\nI said “really? It’s one day”\\n\\nHe then said as I tried to change my wording from request to inform (like “I won’t be in this day”) he said “you can’t call off either. Seriously, if u call me that day you’re no longer here”.\\n\\nEnter next MC\\n\\nDay of the rivalry game fast approaches , <PERSON> style, totally unexpected but expected all at once;\\n\\nI text in.\\n\\nI message <PERSON> “hey you said I couldn’t call you today so I’m texting. I won’t be in tonight. I also emailed you along with the division manager ccd in to remind you that Mendys has a policy that allows for requesting off many days in advance. My request was instantly denied three weeks before the game. Now I’m just reminding you that I won’t be there if you’re expecting me “\\n\\nI walked back in my next scheduled day and <PERSON> apologized profusely , saying “why didn’t you tell me ?….”\\n\\nLike I need a reason.   \n",

One of our hottest sellers , besides our grilled chicken wraps , spicy chicken , and chili, is our potatoes.\\n\\nWell top them with whatever you want, they’re delicious, and they’re equally long to prepare. Like 55 minutes long. We try to prepare them ahead of time but so it takes us two cars in a row going on a potato run to wipe us out. That’s what happened this time. Whenever we get low we put more on, and sometimes microwave them from half done when needed.\\n\\nSometimes we’re unsure as to the quality of our potatoes , so we check to make sure they haven’t been waiting around too long and turn bad (they can get mushy or dark, just gross and unservable). That was also the case tonight. Every time we get a potato order through the drive thru we ask them to hold while we check to make sure we have good potatoes.\\n\\nSo grumpy mcCustomer swings by through our drive thru and I greet them “thanks for choosing Mendy’s how can I help you?”\\n\\nI get a very crotchety “I wanna potatoes and a bacon potatoes. Now!”\\n\\nI reply “sir let me check if we have them right now “.\\n\\nI turn to my manager “Bruce “, who is on the prep station because, yet again, somebody called in.\\n\\n<PERSON> heard the guy and began checking. The potatoes in the bin were bad , and right as I’m about to tell the guy no <PERSON> says “oh hold on “ and checks the oven. It was clear that we had potatoes at this point based on his thumbs up, and just as I’m about to tell the good news from mount potato I hear\\n\\n“Damn it azzhole you either do or you don’t!!!!! Tell me right now whether I have potatoes. !!!”\\n\\nEnter <PERSON>\\n\\nI replied instantly\\n\\n“You know what you’re right we either do or we don’t , and seeing where I can’t confirm or deny at this time I’d have to say that No, we don’t have potatoes right now. Sorry!!!!!”\\n\\nThe guy reply’s “well thanks for wearing my funking time azzhole!!”\\n\\n“Oh you’re welcome ….”\\n\\nSeriously , this guy was looking around at all the dirty crooks and the cheats of the world , when he could have been getting down to this. Sick. Beat.\\n\\nThe best part was <PERSON> holding up two potatoes as the guy drove by flipping us off. It was great seeing his angry brace change to bewilderment all the while. Loved it.\\n\\nOn a very unrelated side note, yes I also teach middle school and college This is my third gig if you don’t count tutoring. Just yesterday I stood my kids for the pledge and legit said “thanks for choosing <PERSON> , how can I help you. “. I guess so long as I don’t send my fry guy to detention.   \n",

I usually do drive thru, but here I am being asked to do a refund at the lobby register because I know how.\\n\\nA southern (like if <PERSON> played pickle ball or something) lady ordered four Baggy Bags (her words) with an extra frosty. All chocolate. Okay, cool. We make her all of her food, and last second she decides \"You know what? I don't want those they don't look chocolatey enough. Not at all!\"\\n\\nOkay, fine. We comply, and instead of making the lady give me the credit card to refund the full meal, then then ring her up for the meal without the frosties (about a fifty cent upcharge per) I simply ring up four medium frosties as a direct refund. This amount has her getting back 12.99.\\n\\nShe immediately complained and shouted \"HEY! Azzhat!! That's not the right amount of Frosties!! Enter the right amount of fu--ing frosties and don't cheap out on me!!\" This was roughly translated because it was a heated moment, but she mentioned something about me being cheap. Also,\\n\\nI Never been called an asshat for. I'm honored.\\n\\nI was about to explain that she was getting a refund that's worth half her meal, but the azzhat didn't sit right with me, and made the MC adjustment.\\n\\n\"You know what you're right, you had five frosties, the upcharges for the meals and then the extra one, right? Okay, let me fix that\"\\n\\n​\\n\\nI took a long time to \"figure out\" how to make the refund happen, which required me to take her card multiple times, and then show her that I refunded her for her one full price frosty at $2.13 and then four more frosties at 50 cents each, so it's $4.13 back to her.\\n\\n​\\n\\n\"Oh that can't be right!! \"\\n\\n​\\n\\nI told her just how wrong she was, showing her receipts as she realized what a mistake she made, as her food just kept getting as cold as My Frosty-Flavored Heart.\\n\\n​\\n\\nTLDR: Angry Chocolatier misses out on a 9 dollar discount.\\n\\nSorry because I\"m typing this hunched over instead of washing dishes rn.\\n\\n​   \n",

We’re dragging sixty percent of our kids through a Mesa family day in the fourth, listening to some hyped patriotic-for-the-sake-of-patriotism type music, walking gently thru a crowd of peers, and others. This crowd wasn’t elbow to elbow by any means, it was sparse enough for the WannaBeachBoys to throw tshirts into the crowd and have twenty-something’s have enough room to fill sprint to catch these things. Any kindergarten teacher will tell you that having a runway of space leads to trouble. That’s exactly what it did.\\n\\nSo tshirts start getting launched directly to pretty people and randomly in the air as far as <PERSON> can throw (26 yards). One lands equidistant where I’m standing (still) and <PERSON> the third.\\n\\nHe runs directly into me, hard, nearly hits my wife, so I use my core strength plus some Taichi to shoulder toss this guy wide right (sorry , <PERSON> ). The kid jumps up instantly , saying “hey watch where the f/— you’re going!!!!”\\n\\nHilarious. Time for some MC.\\n\\nThe next t shirt that comes <PERSON> way I make sure to run up right next to him, watching EXACTLY where I’m going. As it approaches I watch exactly where I’m going as I run hands up right for this guy, making sure to watch where I’m going, and making sure that the path I need to run is going his way. I make sure I tell him “hey I’m watching where I’m GOING!”, snag the shirt and toss it to a random kid.\\n\\nWhat’s this? What’s this? A humbled smelly mehhhhhhhhhhsss.\\n\\nAnyway , <PERSON> and his crew of crapfiends huddled up and whispered, and right when they all started to huddle up security stepped in (and probably saved my deductible ).\\n\\nI think we all grew a little that day.   \n",

For the sake of the sub, I'll say that I worked at a school that happened to have a classroom full of adult-aged fifth graders. They had the same maturity as 5th graders, learning 5th and 6th grade Math.\\n\\nAt \"Scrappy-Doo Charter School for Adults\", which actually happened to moonlight as a University of Phoenix campus, I got the upstairs corner office/classroom. I had two walls that were completely windows, 100 percent see through panes. It made it difficult in some ways (like not enough wall space), but overall it worked out. The students loved being able to look outside and see the entire neighborhood. When I say ALL windows, I mean ALL... I'm 6'2\", and from slightly above my knees all the way up to the ceiling it was see through panes of glass. It was gorgeous.\\n\\nDespite being a school that teaches \"Adult fifth graders\" and beyond, we had lockdown procedures that we practiced monthly. During a lockdown, all staff and students had to be \"below all outward-facing windows\" for the entire lockdown. I had the group of us sit criss-cross applesauce (which was fun to see with this group of Billy-Madison style giant fifth graders) and we took turns telling scary stories in a whisper.\\n\\nMy principal did NOT like this one bit. He burst in during our Mockdown and yelled at everybody, saying \"You have to be as low as possible so you don't DIE from a stray BULLET!\". Wow. Despite these kids being adults, they were still, in a sense, kids. Way to freak them out for next time, asshole.\\n\\n​\\n\\nAnyway, wouldn't you know it, a month and a half later something goes down at the \"Handler Mall\" where a domestic dispute turns into a kidnapping by gunpoint. The man took his former significant other around, right past our school. We went on lockdown quickly, and this time I was ready for some mighty fine MC.\\n\\n​\\n\\nWe got as low as possible. We all had pillows and blankets that I let them previously stash, brand new, in our closets in backup cubbies, and we all had nap time. Me included. I did not plan on laying down and actually sleeping, I just wanted to see the look on my principal's face when he saw a room full of manchildren having naptime during an actual emergency and lockdown. I got to see his face after hearing him bang on my door, which I somehow propped shut with a chair. His furious face made me so friggin happy. It's one of the best joys of my life, along with those \"kids\". They were all great.   \n",

Is it a good thing to \"take\" ideas? Is it all for nought that any idea that pops into our heads has, in some way, been thought of before? Is it an act of passion or a lack thereof that triggers this? Critics throw flowers at directors' feet when they \"pay homage\" yet they criticize and reduce films when they are \"too much\" like their influencers. Imitation is the highest form of flattery. I'm just as guilty as anyone else, making comparisons where I can throughout my cinematic journey. Humans also learn best through witnessing examples and enduring repetition. We improve upon what came before, or try, at least.\\n\\nClearly the 2010 film, Certified Copy, has lived rent free in my head since I viewed it months ago... Iranian director <PERSON> tried to limit watching cinema so he would refrain from copying and regurgitating material. The various levels in which we actively or passively retain influences is innumerably complex, bifurcating into tinier and tinier fragments/ideas/sources.\\n\\n<PERSON> work belongs in this discussion respectfully, as his influence to modern cinema is obvious, as well as where he took influence from. Dragon Inn is a one-location classic stacked with numerous stare-downs, as well as a handful of scenes with proper use of tension. These character interactions are direct ancestors to your modern day <PERSON> and <PERSON> as well as the more obvious contemporary martial arts film in say Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\\n\\nTwo of <PERSON> scenes in particular, both of which revolve around poisoned wine, are comedic vaudevillian masterclasses. There is a clear connection to <PERSON> or <PERSON> & <PERSON> slapstick, in order to not end up poisoned or walk away as the one with the bag of money in the end. The martial arts I've seen have lightly displayed this kind of magic but never really brought it to the forefront like in Dragon Inn.\\n\\nWhat aids the old school tactics is King <PERSON>'s camera, making what would be your typical swords film into something much more romantic; a simple yet lavish set, colorful costumes, warm horizons, and the relationships that come out of the proceedings. It naturally becomes an ode to a singular nomadic lifestyle, in nature, away from political warmongering and the like. The plot also harbors a sense of family and togetherness as the Yu Clan kids are in danger of capture from a General.\\n\\nCan't say this is better than Come Drink With Me as they both have unique qualities I admire. It was much easier for me to pick up on where <PERSON>'s influences came from this go-around, and I'm excited to see how that changes if at all as I go deeper into the mix.   \n",

The mirror suggests universal symmetry yet none are the same. You see what you want. Yours is a world well worn, predetermined, a purgatorial state of unbecoming. Your venial faults and transgressions water you down to a vehicle of unsatiated hypothalamus. The gorgeous blonde is a psycho hose beast, lulling your weak instinct into greater depravity. She is the snake charmer who defiles, the succubus that controls your world without time, which leaves you unraveling at work as you laugh at daytime soaps. The \"wife material\" yells and beckons to your deaf ears, and your use by the blonde converges simultaneously into your use by others. The plan was never yours and that's a kind of Hell. A world perceived without freewill is maddening. The climb against temptation is grueling. The fall is easy. Alas, the consequences are cosmic.   \n",

I watch as people walk past my coworker(s) standing at their registers waiting for a customer to come to mine and my lights not on yet nor am I logged on. It's like GO TO ONE OF MY COWORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN HERE FOR A LITTLE BIT AND ARE READY. These are not regulars here too see me they're just dumbass customers who go \"oh let's go to the register with the cashier not ready durrr\"\\n\\nThroughout the day customers will literally do the ignore my coworkers with no customers to stand behind a customer I'm already helping them they act dumb when they say they didn't see my coworker (these are the customers who also think that if they see me helping a customer already that I'm the only cashier). DUDE! from all directions people come from to walk to the register I can clearly see which register(s) are open don't pretend that you don't\\n\\nThere are times where my coworkers will only have 1 customer in their line while I have like 5.\\n\\nIt's annoying and irritating   \n",

First time she hopped on a register because she thought she was a cashier or could get away without bagging. Second time she went and complained that she was hired as a cashier not a bagger and it's too hard bagging for the amount of time a bagger is scheduled for. So management told her she'd only be scheduled as a cashier. She still bags but only when it's \"convenient\" for her\\n\\nI recently started dialysis for CKD and my arm really hurts after my session so I said when needed I don't want to bag to give my arm a break and what not. I only bag when it doesn't trigger the pain in my arm (feels like my arm is being squeezed really really hard) at times because of the needles and since I'm new to the dialysis scene.\\n\\n<PERSON> did not like that so she tried to complain that it wasn't fair I didn't have to bag. She was met with due to medical reasons they are allowing this to happen\\n\\nShe said in earshot that if you can't do the job you're scheduled to do then you shouldn't be working. I so wanted to laugh out loud at that but I stayed quiet and rolled my eyes out of view\\n\\nI've been wanting to say to her \"Why the hell are you complaining about me not having to bag when you yourself went and complained about being scheduled as a bagger and got your way?\"\\n\\nLike don't go getting your way about something then complain because I don't have to do the same thing!   \n",

I think that the issue lies primarily with the screenplay.\\n\\nAll of the characters seem one note and there isn't any real conflict. Even the crux of the story between <PERSON> and his wife doesn't have a lot of emotion or depth, IMO. I didn't gain much insight into the people or events involved (besides the fact that <PERSON> was an asshole). Because of these issues, the emotional backbone of the story didn't land for me.\\n\\nBesides all that, First Man is a technical marvel. The cinematography, special effects, sound design, and direction of the action sequences are all incredibly well done. I loved the claustrophobic feel to all the scenes in the shuttle; it really gives you a perspective of what the astronauts were experiencing. The entire moon landing scene is excellent.\\n\\nOverall, First Man is good but the whole film is not greater than the sum of its parts.

You're welcome.\\n\\nSome people rag on Casino for being a ripoff of <PERSON>'s widely lauded 1990 classic, Goodfellas. And yes, the similarities are pretty clear. Both are brilliant 90s gangster films exploring similar themes, stories & characters, Both have the inimitable style and suave we've all come to expect from <PERSON>. Same screenwriters, very similar cast - <PERSON> typecast as pretty much the same murdering looney - you get the idea.\\n\\nBut I'm gonna go out on a limb with a spicy hot-take that Casino is better than Goodfellas, and my reasoning is simple enough: the performances. Given, performances are a strong point in Goodfellas; <PERSON> and <PERSON> are phenomenal. But, I don’t think anyone in Goodfellas touches <PERSON> and <PERSON> in Casino (not to mention <PERSON> is still very good). I also think that Casino has a more succinct and defined storyline, whereas Goodfellas is pretty much a bunch of gangsters hangin out, shootin the shit and doing crazy stuff. Don’t get me wrong, still hilariously entertaining, I just prefer the former.\\n\\nAnyways, it doesn’t really matter which one is better; they’re both fantastic films by a world-class storyteller. Maybe Casino is better from a pure entertainment standpoint while Goodfellas is a more charming technical marvel. Who cares?\\n\\nEither way, go watch it on Netflix before it’s gone, especially if you haven’t seen it.\\n\\n'Scorsese - Ranked' |||| 'Favorite Movies of All Time'   \n",

He's always been great at writing enigmatic, self-possessed female characters who usually have some kind of silent torment brewing underneath their surface.\\n\\n<PERSON> & <PERSON>, the two central characters, start off as two icy strangers merely tolerating each other’s presence, and transform into a dynamic duo on the run, revealed as two unhappy women hoping to escape their circumstances. They become united by one enemy – <PERSON>’s boss and <PERSON>’s (ex) lover. This enemy has exploited them both in different ways – he undervalues <PERSON>’s labour & generally treats her poorly, and he romantically & emotionally mistreats <PERSON>.\\n\\nIt takes place on the day of <PERSON> death, so his songs are often playing wherever they go, as if death/danger/threat is always looming over them. A sense of urgency is established in the very first scene where we see two hands doing a tense dance around a map on the table. The idea of transience is central too, like the way <PERSON> keeps her life in Germany rootless (living in hotels or her car) because she yearns to escape it.\\n\\nThe last 15-20mins of this really stand out and you can appreciate the dynamic <PERSON> has subtly established between the two women. I always prefer when writers establish their characters by having them interact with each other instead of having them react to external things that can often bloat the narrative.\\n\\nA welcome addition to the Thelma & Louise/Bonnie & Clyde \"Lovers on the Run\" genre.   \n",

I felt like there was always double of everything\\n\\nPan is an absolute delight and really reminds me why i love the medium of film to tell stories.\\n\\n<PERSON> creates a two and a half minute cocoon of clips and images about her identity and upbringing as someone who is half Japanese & half Venezuelan. She talks about the similarities between the Spanish and Japanese language (\"Pan\" means \"bread\" in both), and how she learned that you don't have to try and define yourself as just one thing, or fit just one box. Accepting the \"in between\" is a gatway to self-discovery.\\n\\nAll the parts of this come together to create something so serene and comforting. It took me on a short little emotional journey that i wasn't prepared for lol\\n\\nWATCH HERE!!!! IT RULES!!!!   \n",

But as someone whose only seen a small handful of his work (The Great Dictator, City Lights, and most recently, Modern Times), the thought never crossed my mind until now. Now, after seeing a much older <PERSON> craft Limelight, I'm now forced to think about the greater significance and mastery of <PERSON>.\\n\\nThis semi-biographical tale stars <PERSON> as <PERSON>, a washed up comedian and stage actor who starts taking care of a suicidal ballerina (<PERSON>) after saving her life.\\n\\nThis is the most experienced and confident I've seen <PERSON> on screen and with greater age, he's improved after already being a masterful entertainer. As always, <PERSON> wrote, directed, and starred in this film and in all departments, he just makes it all look so easy. As an actor, he puts the utmost passion into his performance whether he tries to make you laugh or pull at your heartstrings. As a writer, he crafts a very poignant and tight story; even if it does run a little longer than it needs to. And in the director's chair, he's a master manipulator when it comes to packing emotional punches into his audience. He just gets it. He knows exactly what his audience wants, he knows how to make them laugh, and he knows how to break their hearts. And it works with flying colors every time.\\n\\nThe only issues I had with the film were that some of the on-stage performances ran so long that they slowed the film down for me and <PERSON> performance is a bit too melodramatic for my liking. Even then, these aren't major issues in that they didn't detract too much from my enjoyment of the film. <PERSON> is still working at his very best at this point in his career and while I wouldn't call this his very best film, it sits proudly among some of his most classic films if one were to rank them.\\n\\nIt's funny, it's endearing, it's hopeful, it's heartbreaking...it's <PERSON> and no one did it better.   \n",

Enter <PERSON>, a mysterious character who hires <PERSON> to find a missing white woman. What <PERSON> initially thinks would be some easy money spirals into a chaotic experience laced with twists, murder, and of course, a devil in a blue dress.\\n\\nThis film does a great job incorporating film noir elements. It's a genre I've only seen a handful of films from, but I can definitely tell that any recognizable noirish elements fit perfectly in this film. The story is gripping not only due to a rich, twist filled, suspense filled, thrill a minute story, but because of a colorful cast of characters headed by <PERSON>. <PERSON> is great as always and does an excellent job transforming from reluctant hero to badass detective, but it's <PERSON> who undeniably steals the show. While <PERSON> brings the charm, <PERSON> brings the crazy and his character is so much fun to watch. Him and <PERSON> also share some fantastic chemistry the more you see their unique friendship; almost a brotherly bond of sorts. <PERSON> brings class and elegance to a femme fatale like role. She has her own instantly likable charm to her, but also a crafty, shady side of her own. You see why her character can win so many people over in the film despite their better judgements. Then there's <PERSON> whose sinister eyes mixed with a slimy, dangerous exterior makes for a damn good antagonist.\\n\\nI only had two problems with the film and they were more personal problems that actual problems with the film. The first is the narration. I get it's a film noir trope, but I've never liked narration. I don't like being told stuff that I'm already seeing or I can figure out myself. There's one scene where it works effectively, but that's it for me. Maybe it'll grow on me the more I watch this. And the other problem is that the movie left me wanting more. It's not a bad ending--great ending--but you can tell they set up an Easy Rawlins franchise we never got and it's so disappointing when you think about what could've been. I would've loved seeing countless Easy Rawlins sequels. But knowing we didn't get it--to loosely quote something <PERSON> said on his <PERSON> podcast--it's like watching a <PERSON> origin story end as soon as <PERSON> puts on the cowl for the first time.\\n\\nDespite those minor things, I kind of loved Devil in a Blue Dress and it's still pretty high on not only my list of favorite <PERSON> features (probably my 2nd fave <PERSON> film), but favorite films PERIOD.\\n\\nAnd again, if you do end up watching (or rewatching) this, make sure to turn the color down on your tv/computer. Looks way better that way; like a true blue film noir.   \n",

A revolutionary of all sorts, a trait that I've always admired in filmmakers, and watching my first <PERSON> on the big screen is a dream come true. A strictly dialogue oriented cinema which is cruel to witness as how <PERSON> makes the audiences helpless.\\n\\nA film that starts off as a conflict of interests between a producer, who can be called as a narcissistic man and the director regarding how the realized film should look. This debate eventually sees the entry of a new screenwriter who has to edit certain scenes according to the producer. This creates a domestic rift between the screenwriter and his wife (<PERSON>).\\n\\nWhat's fascinating to me is how much this film relies on the interactions between <PERSON> and <PERSON>. <PERSON>'s way of improvising is way more austere, and sometimes feels cruel as back and forth between the couple feels more sinister which gradually spirals into a much bigger problem. <PERSON> brilliant sense of space helps this film as <PERSON> incorporates the spaces between the apartment to signify the fall of the couple's marriage.\\n\\nContempt is a word which literally translates to \"the feeling that a person or a thing is worthless or beneath consideration.\"\\n\\nThis sneaky feeling is what makes the film more interesting as it's the character of <PERSON> is the one who gets this sensation and thus the well established love slowly fades. We see how much the character of <PERSON> played by <PERSON> feels like a pawn for her husband who uses her to please the producer.\\n\\nBut it's the swing of the power dynamics as ggradually the character of <PERSON> see how much detached <PERSON> really has become. The regret is instantaneous.\\n\\nThe final half of the film features primarily long shots with beautiful color compositional passages as the distance is significant to make us realize the irreparable drift that the married and love life of <PERSON> has taken the form off.\\n\\n<PERSON> has crafted a film that can be interpreted from different povs. The architectural design, the color pallette, screenplay, the future and past events that intercuts the continuity of the film, each and every movement by the characters makes for an excellent practice of impressionistic masterclass of acting and directing, and other technical aspects of filmmaking.   \n",

The film's stripped down approache and the super fluid narrative makes up a pretty simple yet compelling watch.\\n\\nThe main focal point of this film is how multi-faceted each student is, and how their pov is different from each other. The main character of Annie is perhaps the professional victim of the head professor's own personal prejudice against him. The casual approach which the authorities carry out their official duties, and many such aspects of the student's life is shown with great details. Also the rebellious and woke undertones that this film carries throughout, until the end is very interesting and introspective to look at.   \n",

That's what we get to see here and I LOVED IT.\\n\\nWe see everything through <PERSON> unprejudiced eyes: from pleasure, to relationships, to control, and toxicity, and the way some men view and desire women and why, to work and self-reliance, to daddy issues, and money, and empathy, and guilt... EVERYTHING. And it was the most fun and refreshing journey ever, filled with unique characters and hilariously deep dialogue that I will never forget.\\n\\nI feel like <PERSON> always sits down about to write a script and goes: \"WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF...\" and then produces the most primal, deconstructed, insanely original story that's not fully rooted in reality but it's also somehow very pragmatic and also idealistic at the same time???\\n\\nIt's just genius, and the epitome of film innovation imo.\\nHis existence makes me excited for movies.\\nCan't wait to see what he'll do next.\\n\\nAlso <PERSON> performance was an experience on its own and I LOVED <PERSON> in this.\\n\\n—\\n\\nES\\n\\nImaginen re-experimentar y re-aprender el mundo a través de una mirada sin prejuicios y altamente lógica que solo se podría conseguir despojándola de todo conocimiento preconcebido y todo constructo social y prácticamente volviendo a nacer, en un cuerpo que definitivamente va a estar expuesto a todo lo peor y todo lo mejor de este mundo, además. Eso es lo que vemos en esta película Y ME ENCANTÓ.\\n\\nVemos todo a través de los ojos imparciales de Bella Baxter: desde el placer, hasta las relaciones, el control, la toxicidad, la forma en la que algunos hombres ven y desean a las mujeres y por qué, el trabajo, la autosuficiencia, los daddy issues, el dinero, la empatía, la culpa... TODO. Y fue el viaje más divertido y refrescante de la vida, lleno de personajes súper únicos y diálogos graciosamente profundos que nunca voy a olvidar.\\n\\nSiento que <PERSON> siempre se sienta a escribir un guión y dice tipo: \"QUE PASARÍA SI...\" y termina creando la historia más elemental, deconstruida y ridículamente original que no está completamente arraigada en la realidad pero de alguna manera también es súper pragmática y al mismo tiempo idealista???\\n\\nEs una genialidad y el epítome de innovación en el cine, en mi opinión.\\nSu existencia me hace emocionarme por las películas.\\nY no puedo esperar a ver qué va a hacer en el futuro.\\n\\nTambién la actuación de <PERSON> fue una experiencia por sí sola y AMÉ a <PERSON> en esta peli.   \n",

We’re dragging sixty percent of our kids through a Mesa family day in the fourth, listening to some hyped patriotic-for-the-sake-of-patriotism type music, walking gently thru a crowd of peers, and others. This crowd wasn’t elbow to elbow by any means, it was sparse enough for the WannaBeachBoys to throw tshirts into the crowd and have twenty-something’s have enough room to fill sprint to catch these things. Any kindergarten teacher will tell you that having a runway of space leads to trouble. That’s exactly what it did.\\n\\nSo tshirts start getting launched directly to pretty people and randomly in the air as far as <PERSON> can throw (26 yards). One lands equidistant where I’m standing (still) and <PERSON> the third.\\n\\nHe runs directly into me, hard, nearly hits my wife, so I use my core strength plus some Taichi to shoulder toss this guy wide right (sorry , <PERSON> ). The kid jumps up instantly , saying “hey watch where the f/— you’re going!!!!”\\n\\nHilarious. Time for some MC.\\n\\nThe next t shirt that comes <PERSON> way I make sure to run up right next to him, watching EXACTLY where I’m going. As it approaches I watch exactly where I’m going as I run hands up right for this guy, making sure to watch where I’m going, and making sure that the path I need to run is going his way.

I was reading a story about dead fish and instantly got brought back to a story I had long since forgotten, back in the recesses of my withering mind. Back when I was a cashier for a large grocery store that is a homonym for my favorite food.\\n\\nI had plenty of experience in retail, as I previously worked at a cross town rival for many years. I found my self cashiering for a manager who perpetually treated me like an idiot, and despite being able to tell people their change before I punch in the total, he insists that I “stop showing off like a little asshole”. Um excuse me? I’m 6 2 280. I’m far from little. Anyway, this is really all unrelated except that he didn’t like me, repeatedly nsukted me, and watched me like a hawk.\\n\\nI was scanning groceries for some resting-confused-faced lady who looked at the screen after every scan as if she just arrived on the planet. I finally get to a stack of cat food cans that looks suspiciously stuck together. I used to stock groceries , and have seen this before; cat food cans damaged and get stuck together. My old boss said to scan if we CAN (his stupid joke lol ) and toss in the bin. That’s all the training I ever received.\\n\\nSo anyways Manager HatesTheWorld is bagging, the lady is looking like she’s studying the particles in the air, and I take the double can and put it off to the side to get ready to call for a replacement.\\n\\nBefore I could say a thing, the lady gets huffy and says to just “separate the cans , don’t be an idiot”. This got the attention of Manager <PERSON> as he says “you heard her, separate the cans!”\\n\\nOkay. YOU get some MC, You get some MC, Everybody’s going home today with some MC!\\n\\nI saw that the twocan was expired. I knew that this wasn’t going to be good. Even cat food cans that weren’t expired were gross when they got stuck together. I admittedly protested initially, but I was shut down pretty quickly, so I grabbed two plastic bags as gloves, opened the cans (A difficult task) and it literally popped as I pried it. The most disgusting looking, smelling zhit permeated the air. We shut down my lane. Confused lady is now grossed out lady covered In what used to be cat food. She just leaves. I run to the restroom to wash up, come out to see my manager cleaning up the mess with his head turned away.\\n\\n“What are you doing, help me!”\\n\\nOh I’m sorry, I’m highly reactive to horrible smells!” I reply.\\n\\nThis isn’t normally true , but for this particular smell, I just couldn’t. Knowing what botulism most likely was there, I suggested having them fill out a report and call some people, as per OSHA MSDS requirements.\\n\\nThings eventually got cleaned up, and valuable lessons about health and safety were learned by all that day\\n\\nSorry cuz mobile.   \n",
