It's this kind of mean spiritedness that defines the film, from the characters to the situations they create for themselves.\\n\\nSupposedly a comedy from the male perspective, very few of the characters ring true. The men themselves are hapless, bumbling idiots, so sure of their masculinity that they are unable to accept their (many) flaws, whilst the women are either screaming harpies, dumb conquests or manipulative ice maidens.\\n\\nIt's not all bad though. There are a few genuinely amusing moments, and &lt;PERSON&gt;, who is the one genuinely nice guy, does well with what little the script gives him.\\n\\nIf this is what modern relationships are like, count me out.\\n\\nHow's &lt;PERSON&gt;?\\nNot appearing until around the 42 minute mark, &lt;PERSON&gt;'s &lt;PERSON&gt; was the only other character I didn't destest. The scenes with her and &lt;PERSON&gt;'s &lt;PERSON&gt; are sweet, and it was nice seeing their relationship blossom, although more time is spent with the other, more hateful characters. &lt;PERSON&gt;'s well documented of screen partying seems to have taken it's toll though, as she sounds like she's smoked a pack of cigarettes every time she opens her mouth.</td>\n",

So no dude it wasnt me. You knew what time it was your reservation due to your shitty ass broken phone was the one who was fucking it up not me.\\n\\nHe had the dog and it still caost him like 180 woth the pet fee. And i charged it out before he left my desk. He is one of those who will turn their card off. Im making sure we got the money.\\n\\nAnd i blocked out the last standard room on pourpose.\\n\\nAnyway i jsut had a conversation that with the owner as to why... he said cause its been slow and he needs the money. So he got rid of the list that he himself told me to make.\\n\\nWe have not been slow this week almost every night we have been booked out. So spare me the bull shit Nile.\\n\\nI just threw my hands up and said hey om just letting you know.

It's this kind of mean spiritedness that defines the film, from the characters to the situations they create for themselves.\\n\\nSupposedly a comedy from the male perspective, very few of the characters ring true. The men themselves are hapless, bumbling idiots, so sure of their masculinity that they are unable to accept their (many) flaws, whilst the women are either screaming harpies, dumb conquests or manipulative ice maidens.\\n\\nIt's not all bad though. There are a few genuinely amusing moments, and <PERSON>, who is the one genuinely nice guy, does well with what little the script gives him.\\n\\nIf this is what modern relationships are like, count me out.\\n\\nHow's <PERSON>?\\nNot appearing until around the 42 minute mark, <PERSON>'s <PERSON> was the only other character I didn't destest. The scenes with her and <PERSON>'s <PERSON> are sweet, and it was nice seeing their relationship blossom, although more time is spent with the other, more hateful characters. <PERSON>'s well documented of screen partying seems to have taken it's toll though, as she sounds like she's smoked a pack of cigarettes every time she opens her mouth.   \n",
       "11  Paris, Texas\\n\\nIn many ways, Paris, Texas is one of the most significant movies I’ve seen in a while. Technical aspect wise it has some neat camerawork and I can understand why it has garnered so much praise from the audience. The repetitive guitar tune is great as it sets the melancholic and emotive feel in this road trip movie. Some standouts are personally the peep talk/mirror scenes and the hallway scene in green and red lighting to name a few, the dialogue between <PERSON> and <PERSON> was genuinely intense and heartbreaking. One of the things I didn’t like was character wise, how much of an insufferable father <PERSON> is and the way he treats everyone especially to <PERSON> and <PERSON>. At the start, his brother <PERSON> made huge effort to travel to Texas and helped him get back on his feet and to get rid of his “muteness” and “amnesia” and all <PERSON> did was walk away and make things difficult between them. From my understanding, the message of this movie is about reconnection and redemption, when <PERSON> decided to make amendments with <PERSON> and reconnect with <PERSON> in the second half only to drive away and leave them in the hotel because he has come to terms that they will not be happy if they’re back together again. So in conclusion <PERSON> is a miserable dick and <PERSON> and <PERSON> are just better off without him.\\n\\nAlso I feel like I could use a rewatch at some point, it was a bit of a struggle to watch as there was no subtitles and some mf’s watch was beeping on and off at the third half of the movie and during the climatic scenes which took me out of the movie a little eek\\n\\nPriority watchlist   \n",

Because they smoked in the room has the aggressive dog and trashed the room.\\n\\nThe owner told him not to come back literally to his face.\\n\\nSo i come in after being off yesterday and lowandbehold he has come back. 🙃\\n\\nI say something to the owner but they act like they dont give two shits\\n\\nSo what was the whole big deal last time then?\\n\\nHe comes to the desk today wanting to basically to the standard room and upgrade cause hes a starrbellysneech memeber.\\n\\n(You dont get an upgrade on booked out nights and its only to the suite not studio if its avaliable)\\n\\nAnd of couse they gotta do this at 11 right at check out time. With a fuck ton of shit packed into their room on a (1 night stay)\\n\\nHousekeeping knocks like 4 times they keeps shewing them away so the owner tells the guy hey its 1130 yall need move to the new room.\\n\\nOf cousrse he starts to argue saying i didnt let him check back in Which is a lie.\\n\\nHis phone signal was shit so he had to go outside and book it cause he didnt want to pay the higher rate.\\n\\nFinally it came through and i check him in within like 2 min. So no dude it wasnt me. You knew what time it was your reservation due to your shitty ass broken phone was the one who was fucking it up not me.\\n\\nHe had the dog and it still caost him like 180 woth the pet fee.

Im making sure we got the money.\\n\\nAnd i blocked out the last standard room on pourpose.\\n\\nAnyway i jsut had a conversation that with the owner as to why... he said cause its been slow and he needs the money. So he got rid of the list that he himself told me to make.\\n\\nWe have not been slow this week almost every night we have been booked out.

I feel things *really* deeply.\"\\n\\nI quite enjoyed X. While it seemed like just another slasher, the aesthetic, acting, and character development were enough for it to stand out as a delight.\\n\\nI also knew this wasn't going to be a slasher, or at least not in quite the same blatant way. I was also a little worried about this prequel coming out after X, since we know how this character is in that film.\\n\\nThis is somehow not only a little better, but also makes X even better. This is a visual treat of a psychological character horror. The Technicolor feel pops on the big screen, the color correction and editing doing wonders (at least as much as a 2020s production can).\\n\\n<PERSON> *is* the star that <PERSON> so desperately believes she is. From the expressions and whiplash in behaviors, to that one scene, this is her showcase. Also, in a role that is being extremely overlooked in my opinion, <PERSON> as <PERSON>'s father emotes so much while being able to do very little.\\n\\nThe only thing that I'm a little soft (heh) on is the mother-daughter dynamic that just felt a little flat to me. Nothing on the acting, the path was just predictable.   \n",

       "      <td>Five Nights at Freddy's\\n\\nI'll start by saying I've never played the games, read the books or seen anything about FNAF so I don't have any sort of connection to it like many younger ones do. I just missed the trend when it became extremely popular. I can see why it's popular, the concept is actually great, this film however is utter trash.\\n\\nA mess from start to finish. I remember seeing that it was originally 3hrs before getting cut down, it's evident right from the start. Just all over the place. I had hopes that maybe the final act would save it, but nope it's laughably bad. It jumps from &lt;PERSON&gt; running perfectly to him then limping as if his legs been sawed off, pretty funny. I wonder if Blumhouse will release an extended or directors cut, that could possibly turn it into a good film for casuals. The big reveal was shite and predictable, and the way it's dealt with it just unacceptable. Like really? That's it? Rushed &amp; ultimately underwhelming.\\n\\nThe animatronics are the highlight, they're fantastic. Real shame they're not in it much. The first 80 minutes is just involves sleeping with some teases of the animatronics. All the characters look brilliant, I understand why they all have a huge fanbase. Couldn't pick a favourite but &lt;PERSON&gt; looked really cool. The film manages to create a pretty decent atmosphere that's worth a mention. Lighting in particular is impressive in many of the diner scenes.\\n\\nI know this is PG-13 in America which is fine, however I have no idea how its a 15 here in the UK. There is no gore or swearing, maybe it's because the overall story with the children but it doesn't go into it enough to justify the rating imo.\\n\\nFNAF does down as a huge wasted potential. The concept is great, but the film does nothing with it. It leaves more questions than answers. Maybe the sequels will be better because they're definitely gonna turn this into a huge franchise with the success it's had. I'm glad that fans had the experience they were looking for. Must have been fantastic for them.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City\\n\\nI'm not sure how to rate this one. There's moments I really like, but also ones I hate. Best thing for me is all the homages and easter eggs, honestly they're outstanding. Literally every few minutes I'm getting excited over something. However, the scenes are then followed by some awful dialogue. The script really let's it down, it's a shame. They describe literally everything you already see on screen. We all know by now these are iconic characters, no need for them to say their whole name every 30 seconds. Right on the nose about it being set in 1998 as well, don't they realise they've already told us? People aren't going to forget.\\n\\nCharacter designs are good, they nail nearly every outfit. &lt;PERSON&gt; with no hat is painful though, maybe I'm being too much of a fan boy. Some character decisions are bad, i hate what theyve done with &lt;PERSON&gt;. Performances are good, they do a good job with what they've been given. We dont spend enough time with each character, so people who arent fans of the games will ultimately not care about their outcomes by the time the final act arrives, this is down to them introducing way too many things for a first film. Cinematography is great, there's loads of lovely shots that I will remember. Atmosphere is on point. Topped off with a good score &amp; soundtrack, could have done without that particular RPD scene tbh.\\n\\nThe film is just a bad mix of old and modern filmmaking. They were so close to doing something great here. I'm giving this 3 stars. I adore all the homages and easter eggs, someone else described it as easter egg the movie, couldn't say it better myself. That combined with the brilliant cinematography cement my rating. On this rewatch I'm even sadder at the wasted potential. This could have been great. I'm probably sitting alone because I still enjoyed it. I'm a sucker for b-movies, zombies, RE &amp; references.</td>\n",

I´ve already written a lot about this film, so here is the short version. It´s a tale about human madness, greed, ambition, and colonial hybris dwarfed by a magnificent, uncaring natural world. Immersively filmed like a documentary, “Aguirre, the Wrath of God” is filled with evocative images, an entrancing score, a fever dream atmosphere, and Herzog´s offbeat humor. And &lt;PERSON&gt; stare will haunt me forever.\\n\\nSome random thoughts:\\n-The pan flute player is the equivalent of the musicians in “Titanic”\\n-The ship in the tree is one of the most striking images in Herzog´s career\\n-I wonder if Aguirre´s posture and gait was an inspiration for &lt;PERSON&gt; of &lt;PERSON&gt;\\n\\nHere and here are my previous, more detailed reviews.

The movie adaptation – produced by legendary producer &lt;PERSON&gt;, who came to fame cinematically for Terms of Endearment – indeed feels like it could be a 1980s Oscar Best Picture contender, given it’s about as average, run-of-the-mill Novel Adaptation Cinema as there is, which is to say – it’s OK. There’s nothing remarkable about any aspect of the film; it just exists with &lt;PERSON&gt; (this her second feature) directing her whole crew to averageness. Is it an OK movie that I enjoyed? No, hence the non-passing grade. But it’s not harmful and just… OK.\\n\\nContent-wise, I’m not sure this story has as much impact in 2023 that it would have for kids in the 70s and 80s, with the monotheistic conflict between Christianity and Judaism and the question of the role of God in a middle schooler’s life feeling FAR less interesting now than 50 years ago. So, what I see remaining is an innocuous 100-minute hangout movie with a sixth grader, her eerily overly-happy parents, and some caricature relationships in both her school and extended family.\\n\\n&lt;PERSON&gt; is infectious to watch, for sure, though I’m not sure she’s doing a great performance or just being naturally watchable &lt;PERSON&gt;. Regardless, she’s certainly a high point of the film. &lt;PERSON&gt; is her most interesting in years and young &lt;PERSON&gt; is fine and steady enough. &lt;PERSON&gt; appears to have put in the least amount of effort into his role.\\n\\nIn the end, if one loves the book, there’s a chance nostalgia will win them over with the movie.

I was working for a well known catering company based out of Maryland. They were contracted to provide servers. There we about 7 of us added to the already 100+ staff working there. The party took place in the Red, Green, and Blue Rooms. There was an area down a set of stairs that people could get their pictures taken with the president and first lady.

The hair pulling occurred at the Halcyon House in Georgetown area of DC. I don't know if it's still used for galas, weddings, company &amp; business conference events. It has a very interesting history. It's a house built on a hill with huge underground basement that was used for big events. It has the most amazing view from the back yard of the Georgetown bridge (Fancis Scott Key brigde) that crosses over the Potomac River to the Rosslyn area of Arlington, VA. You can also see the spires of Georgetown University. Apparently it's also haunted.\\n\\nThe event I was working was for an after conference cocktail meet &amp; greet for a paint company. We were serving white &amp; red wine, sparkling water or flat and hors d'oeuvres. It was an absolute mad house. The group had been in a conference all day without much of a break. They were absolutely ravenous. As soon as I'd walk out of the area we were using as a kitchen. I was mobbed by the guests. I wasn't able to walk more than 10 feet before all of the hors d'oeuvres were gone, in less than 30 seconds. I was supposed to walk around the floor and try to get to the other side of the event space. I don't think I ever got to the far side of the space. We actually had to stagger the hors d'oeuvres because the company hadn't paid for enough food.\\n\\nThe hair pulling occurred probably my 3rd time out. I have long curly hair and would wear it in a high braided ponytail. I'm walking out and I feel a tug on my braid. I whip around to a middle aged woman (&lt;PERSON&gt;) with her hand still in the air. She has the most ashamed look on her face!\\n\\nSW: I'm so sorry.

Too shallow to be the cerebral, spiritual film it’s aiming for, far too baroque for the thrilling blockbuster Disney doubtless asked for when they spent a hundred million US dollars circa 2000 on a movie called “Mission to Mars” based on a theme park ride. In many ways it’s a rote regurgitation of 2001, The Abyss, and Solaris, while simultaneously serving as a foundational urtext for just about every interstellar sci-fi film to come in its wake (&lt;PERSON&gt;’s three 21st century sci-fi films feel particularly indebted to it, though of course each far surpasses it). It’s a work too muddled and muted to truly commend, but too ambitious and earnest not to at least respect. But I wasn’t kidding about that The Abyss shit, the climax of this revolves around &lt;PERSON&gt; discovering he can breathe in an advanced alien liquid.

Considered, substantial, and sincere, if hardly exemplary. Nothing short of a miracle for a film adapting a ho-hum prequel to a franchise whose cultural moment ended in 2014. The ensemble cast is wonderful, though I would’ve liked to have seen &lt;PERSON&gt; and &lt;PERSON&gt; given more to work with. Was very happy to see &lt;PERSON&gt; pop up in the third act. &lt;PERSON&gt; continues to be endlessly charming, and her musical performances here were stellar, even more so than her already stunning work on West Side Story. &lt;PERSON&gt; (who I’m obliged to highlight is a &lt;PERSON&gt; alum) feels like an instant star (or would be if we still had those). Very compelling screen presence with a striking look about him. Was shocked at how quickly I got over the role not being played by a digitally de-aged &lt;PERSON&gt;.\\n\\nAt the same time, it’s far too ambitious structurally, leaving the actual Games to feel like a crowd-pleasing stopgap in a more interesting film, and &lt;PERSON&gt;’s direction is too matter of fact to pull off the more expressive aspects of the narrative, especially the ambiguous climax, which he completely bungles. More broadly troublesome though is the inherent abstraction of the franchise’s approach to oppression. I can sympathize with &lt;PERSON&gt;’s belief that The Hunger Games and its derivatives are important for galvanizing the youth into Leftist politics to an extent, but it’s hard to watch this without recalling that one of the key reasons this genre well dried up was the increasingly disquieting relationship between YA dystopias and the actual, recognizable oppression that these works drew from. The Hunger Games’s dystopian world is at once far too tied to the global liberation struggle for much to be mined from it beyond its propagandistic functions, and not nearly literal enough to feel terribly of value at this point. At 4 books, 5 movies, and 15 years of Hunger Games, it feels like we’ve collectively outgrown a need for it. Or at the very least we should have.</td>\n",

Occasionally a card in the equipment went bad. For reference, many of these cards were $100,000US or more. The vendor kept a set of spares onsite, so malfunctioning equipment could be repaired quickly. Her job was to ship the bad card back. They had a 5-day return time; after that, there was a fine / restocking fee of 10% of the card's retail value.\\n\\nThere were two shipment methods, and each had several (expensive) insurance options. Her boss micro-managed his budget and wanted to select the method and insurance each shipment. One day, she stuck her head in his office, and told him she had a card to return. Apparently, he was having a difficult day because he told her to \"just fucking ship it!\".\\n\\nSo, she did. She selected the more expensive shipper and did not specify any insurance.\\n\\nThe karma? This was one of the only shipments in her time with the company that got lost. The shipping company accepted it, billed the company for shipping, and the card was never heard from again. Her boss spent a few hours a day trying to track it down. The shipper's contract with the company limited their liability to a low amount, so they were out a few thousand dollars. &lt;PERSON&gt;' budget took a hit for the replacement cost of the card, but the vendor was nice enough to waive the restock fee. She was not blamed, since there was no standard policy requiring insurance, and the boss said to just fucking ship it.\\n\\n​\\n\\nEdit: For context, this was early '90s. Shipping orders were created on carbonless forms, and \"tracking\" was very primitive. None of this newfangled know where your package is every step of the way stuff.</td>\n",
       "      <td>It’s Always DNS\\n\\nTl; dr - if you hit only dead ends, you’re probably assuming something that is not true.\\n\\nI support multiple multi-tenant OpenShift Clusters. The various business divisions have their own DevOps staffs; we are corporate and own infrastructure.\\n\\nLast month, an App team contacted me. They were failing DR testing due to a single microservice. Unfortunately it was the key microservice. In production it was called hundreds of thousands of times a day.\\n\\nThe app did little logging around this microservice. Pretty much “called with these args, got this response”. Calls were timing out. Since it was timing out and the service was clearly running, it must be a bug in OpenShift, right? (Oh, did I drop this \\s?)\\n\\nStrangely, api calls to the service timeout; the healthcheck calls get through. Oh, wait, it’s failing those healthchecks! App team turns up logging for the service and finds the service is deadlocking. It’s technically not dead, but it’s not answering the phone.\\n\\nI feel vindicated, Apps fixes it, DevOps deploys, and DR passes. Oops, no, it doesn’t. Instead of a timeout, the call fails.\\n\\nI spent two days tracking the progress of the API call. The api is called with a url containing a fully qualified domain name. Working from the outside in, I rule out DNS^1, the cluster’s BigIP, and the cluster’s ingress routers. Each shows the api call entering and leaving.\\n\\nThat leaves the pod containing the service and the node it is running on. More tcpdump- yes, it reaches the node, no it does not reach the pod. The definitions of the components (Route, Service, Pod) are correct. They’re working perfectly in the production namespace on the primary cluster.\\n\\nStumped, I ask a more experienced coworker to look at it. After a few hours he independently verified my results, but was also stumped.\\n\\nI enter a ticket for Red Hat support. I tell them I’m sure I’m overlooking the obvious and need another set of eyes. (Ooh, look foreshadowing).\\n\\nThe next morning my coworker says, “You’re going to laugh…”. As aside that phrase ranks right up with “We need to talk” on the list of things I hate to hear. On our clusters, namespaces (collections of resources) are isolated from each other. You add network policies to describe the traffic you want to allow. There is a set of cluster-wide default policies that make everything work. On our cluster, those policies are copied into the namespace when it is created.\\n\\nMy coworker found that the default policies had been deleted. The namespace contained only a custom policy permitting the DevOps team’s monitoring traffic. Here’s the gotcha: if the namespace has no network policies, the cluster defaults apply. However, if you have any namespace level policies, only those policies apply. The coworker said that’s why we automatically added them when creating a namespace. Adding them back completely resolved the issue. Healthchecks are generated on the same pod, so they’re not affected by network policy.\\n\\nPost Mortem: the first day of testing the app team noticed the service did not respond. In the course of investigating, &lt;PERSON&gt; accidentally (?) deleted the default network policies. The next day, with the problem unresolved they called us.\\n\\n1 Like users I lie.

He does write the N word into his script so many times, and often it feels like it's there to be shocking (and so he can say it). But here, and in Django Unchained as well, it does have somewhat of a use with showing the time period and the characters in an even less flattering light. But with that said, it can be a bit excessive, and I wouldn't blame anyone for not being comfortable with it. It does have a reason for being here, but I am definitely not someone who should decide if it's necessary.\\n\\nWell, you better shit another pistol out your ass!

It's roughly three hours, very slow paced and dialogue heavy, with some of the most unlikable main characters you'll find in a movie. And I'm sure that if I watched it again, this could very well become my favorite &lt;PERSON&gt; movie. It's so twisted and brutal, so mean-spirted and intertwined, but for all the right reasons.\\n\\nRewatching this and seeing the foreshadowing to genuinely surprising twists is great. No character is quite who they first seem, and seeing the events unfold with that in mind is great because a lot of these characters' actions make even more sense under the new contexts.\\n\\nTheres so much in this film that works, even without the clever writing. The set design and music do a great job of developing the environment and creating an entertaining place for the story to be set. The structure and pacing allows you to get settled in to this cabin with the characters and figure out who you should and shouldn't believe and trust.\\n\\nIt's not something I can recommend enough, for any fan of westerns and &lt;PERSON&gt;'s filmography.

Parasite is a masterpiece, but if you've spent any time on here, you've heard that countless times before, so instead I'll try to add something that's at least newer than the typical praise: my mom usually cannot stand movies with subtitles, but she watched this tonight because of the legacy it already has, and she's already called it one of her favorite movies.</td>\n",

Fury of the Gods is a film that would have divided audiences if audiences were interested enough to watch it in the first place.\\n\\nThis is the fifth consecutive financial failure in the DC extended universe of films, which is an unprecedented series of flops for a franchise. It is the sequel to Shazam!, the first film in their five-film-slump, so should we be surprised that no one saw it?\\n\\nThe sequel follows &lt;PERSON&gt;, a teenager who turns into a superpowered adult just by saying the word “Shazam”, and his foster family, all of whom he has given this same power to. When three Greek gods come to Earth wanting the powers of &lt;PERSON&gt;, they have to fight back.\\n\\nThe film had a budget of $125 million, but is estimated to only make an underwhelming $100 million, which is being attributed to poor marketing, poor reviews and a poor performance of the original.\\n\\nWhat was so fun about the first film was watching this kid try and understand his god-like powers and come to grips with this responsibility. The sequel is less fun just because he is an already established hero, and the film barely tries to focus on the civilian aspect of his life, which is what makes this hero so unique.\\n\\nInstead, they just focus on the superhero element of it, which brings nothing new to the table and struggles to set itself apart from the constant barrage of other new superhero films.\\n\\nIt’s definitely not bad at all, but it’s also definitely not fresh. Our cast of heroes headed up by &lt;PERSON&gt; are suitably fun and funny, and overall, the film does have some great comedic moments. It doesn’t take itself too seriously, and that is definitely what was needed.\\n\\nOn the other hand though, the villains are completely forgettable and unimpressionable, although their blandness doesn’t detract from the overall fun flavour of the film.\\n\\nAt two hours and ten minutes, the film does feel like it outstays it welcome, but on reflection, I don’t know what scenes you could cut – to its credit, the film does manage to give every character a moment to shine, so it feels like if you cut any scenes it would diminish the sequel overall.\\n\\nIt’s not the kind of film you can think about for too long without your opinion on it souring, but it’s the kind of film you won’t have any desire to think on after it’s done – it was fun while it was happening, but the second you leave the cinema, you’re bound to forget it.\\n\\nAlthough Shazam! Fury of the Gods was fun, in the future, all this film will be remembered for is a couple good jokes and as a financial failure. This will be used as an example of how not to market a film and nothing else – it was fun and humorous, but overall, it was mostly bland, unoriginal and unimpressionable.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Godzilla Minus One\\n\\nGodzilla Minus One is a Japanese film about a defected Kamikaze Pilot in post-World War II Japan and his PTSD, the woman and baby he finds amidst the rubble of Tokyo and his plight to overcome his guilt and learning to love again. Oh, and there’s a 150-foot-tall monster destroying the city.\\n\\nThe age-old struggle of &lt;PERSON&gt; films is filling the gaps between monster fights with interesting human drama. But Godzilla Minus One - the 38th &lt;PERSON&gt; film – does this better than any of its predecessors. Here, the human drama is even more interesting than the incredible &lt;PERSON&gt; action.\\n\\n&lt;PERSON&gt; has always been a metaphor. Sometimes for the threat of nuclear weapons, sometimes of the destruction of war and sometimes the effects of climate change. But &lt;PERSON&gt; has never been a more explicit metaphor than he is here.\\n\\nThe titular monster is a manifestation of guilt, a metaphor of the destruction of Japan, a 150-foot-tall ghost from their past. After &lt;PERSON&gt;’s initial magnificent attack on Tokyo, a group of citizens band together to stop the beast – this film is not about the destruction &lt;PERSON&gt; causes, but about the lives that are left behind.\\n\\nThe love story between the two leads, &lt;PERSON&gt; and &lt;PERSON&gt;, is incredible and emotional, and the backdrop of a terrifying monster levelling a city just makes it all the more tragic. The performances are palpable and heart-breaking as our lead, the defected Kamikaze pilot, struggles with why he is left alive after so many others died in the war.\\n\\nThe human drama is the main draw here, but that does not subtract from Godzilla’s rampages. The scale of the monster’s destruction, the swiftness, the indomitable rage of the Kaiju is enthralling. Music is used sparingly in this film, and the score picks up most excellently in these scenes.\\n\\nThe film looks incredible too, despite having a fraction of the budget that an equivalent Hollywood blockbuster would have. The destruction looks real, and &lt;PERSON&gt; looks menacingly palpable.\\n\\nGodzilla Minus One tackles heavy topic such as the waste of life in war, survivors’ guilt and government mismanagement of emergencies while still working as a threatening action film of trying to stop a monster terrorising a city. The balancing act between these two ideas never seems uneven – this film is as poignant, as it is terrifying, as it is magnificent.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Asteroid City\\n\\n&lt;PERSON&gt; second masterpiece in a row, Asteroid City cements him as a far more complex conceptual thinker than I ever would have imagined before this decade. &lt;PERSON&gt; is extraordinary as an actor who gets so far lost in role that he can't necessarily resurface again, ever. If The French Dispatch was &lt;PERSON&gt;'s contribution to a genuinely political cinema in the face of an 'apolitical' era, Asteroid City is &lt;PERSON&gt;'s contribution to moving beyond postmodernism, back to an authentic understanding of 'real' and 'unreal.'\\n\\nThis is a film about the selling of plots within plots. &lt;PERSON&gt;'s character \"sells plots\" and is consistently costumed with his green vizor. Green, of course, is associated in cinema with the idea of greenscreen artificiality, and &lt;PERSON&gt; has of course been accused of being over-artificial in the past by numerous critics, including myself. This is really the entire narrative conceit of the film, both the selling of literal plots of land, but also the selling of plots within plots, plots-as-spectacle, fiction as a machine for plot-making, plots as a way of escaping genuine emotion.\\n\\nAnd as my partner points out, &lt;PERSON&gt; smashes his red photographic safe-light when he is finally asked to 'show real emotion,' to 'use his grief,' but even this is fictional. This is made even more complex because in the play-within-the-film structure, &lt;PERSON&gt; comments to &lt;PERSON&gt; that she \"doesn't like beards,\" but outside of the play, &lt;PERSON&gt; doesn't have a beard, but is also not a heterosexual man. Costumes upon costumes upon costumes. Everything is affect, but affect isn't only superficial anymore. &lt;PERSON&gt; cinema is evolving.\\n\\nSo the devil is in the details: the unfinished road, the Native American employee that guards the settlement post-contact, the ellipse from outer space (imposed by what - God? Aliens? The creator Wes Anderson or &lt;PERSON&gt; himself?), the fact that we ride in to Asteroid City on a train (alternate title: Arrival of a Train at Asteroid City), the fact that &lt;PERSON&gt; once again performs the role of 'narrative spokesman' in a &lt;PERSON&gt; picture, the fact that &lt;PERSON&gt;'s character is named &lt;PERSON&gt;, the fact that she shares her name with &lt;PERSON&gt;'s famously-doubled femme fatale from Vertigo, the fact that her 'look' is clearly an amalgam of &lt;PERSON&gt;'s numerous female leads, the fact that &lt;PERSON&gt;'s vizor is green, and more details, too: the red safety light, the fact that both the spaceman and &lt;PERSON&gt; look the same caught on camera, the fact that &lt;PERSON&gt; and &lt;PERSON&gt; only ever view each other through windows, like an audience watching a play, sure, but also like &lt;PERSON&gt;'s Rear Window, which is also a movie about being an audience watching something unfold... this obviously has a lot to do with &lt;PERSON&gt;. It also plays in dialogue extremely well with &lt;PERSON&gt;'s Nope and &lt;PERSON&gt;'s Oppenheimer - two other films about the destruction of deserts, or at least two other films about the destruction of images of deserts.</td>\n",
       "      <td>&lt;PERSON&gt;\\n\\nThere's not a single other craftsman working that is making films as straightforwardly and excessively brilliant as this.\\n\\nI have little to add in the structure of a formal review, so just some loose thoughts I shared with my Discord group below.\\n\\nSPOILERS FOLLOW.\\n\\nI didn't say much in my review at this stage but I loved everything about it. It's probably the best performances he's wrangled from actors since the early days. This is going to sound bizarre but I kept thinking about how this is kind of like his 'respectable arthouse era' - it's kind of maybe closest to &lt;PERSON&gt; structurally, but much better executed. Like \"people who stand for different ideas all talking in a room with each other\" and in that respect is also a little bit like a &lt;PERSON&gt;-Huillet picture.\\n\\nI recognise that these comparisons are a little ridiculous and overwrought, but the whole film itself functions as a kind of philosophical inquiry or dialogue and I think it's productive to think about the way it functions as a genre-framework version of that.\\n\\nAs far as the way it's photographed, it's probably his flashiest movie since The Happening. It's never 'big' but it's really really 'excessive' formally the whole time lol. I was going wild.\\n\\nThe only minor complaint I have is that I wish it had cut to black about ten seconds before it actually did but I also appreciate that there's a need for the film to ascertain for sure that 'the world beyond those two characters' really does exist and is penetrable so I'm willing to accept it to communicate a bigger idea.\\n\\nI thought the film's queerness was beautifully handled, probably one of my favourite queer films now. Not sure the film itself 'feels queer' but the handling of the queer relationship is really sensitively wrought, which makes sense given that one of MNS' best qualities is his ability to touch on romance and especially divorce in those early pics and that final scene just before &lt;PERSON&gt; is shot is probably the best photography of his career, it's nothing unique to MNS (whereas lots of the rest of the film is incredibly unique), but the 'they're close enough to each other and almost look as if they're about to kiss' functions better here than in any other film I can think of with a similar device.\\n\\nI also think that in this case the PG-13/M rating serves the film really well, it means that violence is photographed in really interesting ways and tends to highlight the action of violence rather than the result, which also operates as an interesting counterpoint to the narrative and philosophical thrust of the dialogue.\\n\\nIt's very slight in everything that it's doing but in some ways that makes the degree to which it is accomplished even more impressive to me. It's not a \"major work\" in the way that, idk, for &lt;PERSON&gt; The Birds is a \"major work\" in terms of scope or for &lt;PERSON&gt; something like War of the Worlds is, it's much closer to a Rope or a Duel or something like that.</td>\n",

Guests were coming in from all over the country. The rooms were assigned by the housing bureau and paid for by their employer. So it had been a crazy night with people finding out they had roommates, a non-smoker had been assigned a smoking room, and two hated competitors assigned to the same room (intentionally done by their boss with notes not to move). One of our last arrivals for this group was a man named &lt;PERSON&gt;. Immediately after &lt;PERSON&gt; checked in he returned to the desk with a young lady in tow. \"There must be a mistake, I'm in a room with a woman I don't know.\" The lady chimes in, \"I'm sure he is a nice guy but staying in a room with a strange man...\" \"I apologize and explained that we didn't assign the rooms. &lt;PERSON&gt; offers to pay for his own room and I explain that we are sold out. There is a hotel on the other side of downtown that has rooms... but of course, all the convention meetings are at our hotel. I do point out that if they can find someone in a single room to switch with I'm more than happy to reassign the rooms. They retire to the bar to figure things out. I later saw them together at the convention's social hour, they approached me and said they would make it work. Could I send up a pair of robes?\\n\\nA year later, I'd forgotten all about &lt;PERSON&gt; and his roommate when I received a call to come to the desk. There at the desk were &lt;PERSON&gt; and his roommate, both with wide smiles on their faces. She was holding her hand up in that way all new brides do. That weekend, a year ago was the start of their whirlwind relationship. They had just gotten married and decided to spend their honeymoon in the city they met in. I helped them plan their sightseeing activities and made restaurant suggestions. They returned for the next two years that I was at that property, the last I heard they had a child on the way and had relocated here.</td>\n",

Because I had some computer experience, I naturally became the onsite tech guy. Four years go by and I have given two months' notice, tired of 12-hour days doing my job plus cobbling together outdated IT for a manager who disliked me. Two months nearly went by with me repeatedly asking my manager (AGM) who was going to be taking my place so that I could train them. With two days left they asked me to train six individual managers on how to manage/maintain the computer systems in their departments.\\n\\nI lived three blocks from the hotel and after I left I would stop by on occasion for a drink or just to say \"Hi.\"On one of my stops, the Front Desk manager commented that he had not done a system backup since I left because he couldn't remember the steps. I went behind the front desk so I could show him, again. A couple of days later my old manager called, while reviewing tapes he'd seen me behind the desk. He informed me that under no circumstance was I to be in hotel work areas, yelling \"You don't work here anymore!\" followed by a slamming of the phone.\\n\\nOne year after I left the hotel I received another call from my old manager, I ignored it. I'm busy doing a full renovation at my new hotel. The next day I received additional calls from my old General manager who I actually liked. When I return the calls I find out the Front Desk manager who I'd trained was fired weeks after my last encounter. The IT system had failed and no backups were done since the one I did. They needed help... I declined. Gossip has it the AGM was fired with this situation being the main cause.

In fact, my memory of them is colored by disappointment, but in fairness, it's been a long time since 2001. So I'm now revisiting this film trilogy, and remaining open to re-evaluation.\\n\\n&lt;PERSON&gt; was clearly a good choice to helm these movies. He brought ample resources to bear, made great use of all those New Zealand locations, and most importantly, was steadfastly loyal to the source works. This first installment does a very good job at setting the stage and establishing mood. The stakes couldn't be higher, and the sense of foreboding is crushing (those Nazgul riders are most effective).\\n\\nBut, too crushing? My only criticism that really carries through from the early 2000s to today is that &lt;PERSON&gt; frequently overdoes it. He gets carried away. His roots as a horror director show in the design of the orcs, the Uruk-hai, even the &lt;PERSON&gt;, along with all the over-the-top stuff to do with &lt;PERSON&gt;, although I think the Bridge of Khazad-dum sequence rocks.\\n\\nI used to be of the opinion that this and the next two pictures weren't really acting showcases, but I take that back to some extent. I was especially impressed here by the command of &lt;PERSON&gt; as &lt;PERSON&gt;. Great role, great performance. &lt;PERSON&gt; is utterly convincing as &lt;PERSON&gt;. But I'll stop there.\\n\\nI remember enjoying \"Fellowship\" considerably more than the next two films, so I'll be interested to see if that holds.\\n\\nSide note --- As a film journalist I did press for all three \"LOTR\" pictures back in the day, interviewed seemingly everyone involved, and New Line showered us with tons of awesome swag. I don't know where it went, but I have none of it today, and you can't find that stuff online anywhere. Makes me sad.\\n\\nLetterboxd Review No. 769</td>\n",

       "      <td>&lt;PERSON&gt;\\n\\n&lt;PERSON&gt;:\\nI think... I think I LOVED this thing. I observe TÁR, as many others — I presume, or at least hope so, to not feel stupid — like an outsider. I listen to, and appreciate, classical music, but I'd never be able to put into words, or even comprehend for that matter, the celestial sublimation music can take you to.\\n\\nCinema, however, usually takes me there, and &lt;PERSON&gt; approach to abuses of power in the Me Too era is riveting in its quietness. Ever innovative and bold, the film explores the validity of art and intellectuality, never forcing a simplistic take to drive the narrative forward. What elevates TÁR then is how it's entirely framed as an intimate character study, and in doing so making the whole issue universal. We are participants of the protagonist's brilliance and lies, her mastery and self-deceptions, and ultimately of her crooked vision of the world.\\n\\n[Enters &lt;PERSON&gt;]:\\nAs confirmed by &lt;PERSON&gt; himself, the film was written with her in mind; and it is easy to see why. If there was anyone who could pull off those lines without sounding absolutely ridiculous, that was &lt;PERSON&gt;. I've seen her do it all, from the extreme tenderness of &lt;PERSON&gt; to the shocking brutality of what she accomplishes here. I keep trying to think of another performance that might resemble her work in this film, but it keeps eluding me.\\n\\nAs it's often said: not a film for everyone. I'm sure the slow pace and unabashedly elongated scenes will bore more than one. As an official representative of slow cinema, this was actually an action-packed thriller, to be honest. A film I'm very sure I'll keep getting back to.\\n\\nSPANISH:\\nCreo... Creo que me ENCANTÓ esta \"cosa\". Observo TÁR, como muchos otros — supongo, o al menos eso espero para no sentirme estúpido — como un extraño. Escucho y aprecio la música clásica, pero nunca sería capaz de expresar con palabras, ni siquiera comprender, esa sublimación celestial a la que puede llevarte la música.\\n\\nEl cine, sin embargo, suele llevarme ahí, y el enfoque de &lt;PERSON&gt; a los abusos de poder en la era del Me Too es fascinante en su aparente silencio. Siempre innovadora y valiente, la película explora la validez del arte y la intelectualidad, sin forzar nunca una visión simplista para hacer avanzar la narración. Lo que eleva a TÁR es cómo se enmarca por completo dentro de un estudio íntimista del personaje principal, y al hacerlo convierte el tema en universal. Somos partícipes de la brillantez y las mentiras de la protagonista, de su maestría y sus autoengaños y, en última instancia, de su torcida visión del mundo.\\n\\n[Enters &lt;PERSON&gt;]:\\nComo confirmó el propio &lt;PERSON&gt;, la película se escribió pensando en ella; y es sencillo entender por qué. Si había alguien que podía interpretar esos diálogos sin parecer absolutamente ridícula, esa era &lt;PERSON&gt;. La he visto hacer de todo, desde la extrema ternura de &lt;PERSON&gt; hasta la impactante brutalidad de lo que consigue aquí. Y por más que intento pensar en otra actuación que pueda parecerse a su trabajo en esta película, se me escapa.\\n\\nComo suele decirse: no es una película para todo el mundo. Estoy seguro de que el ritmo lento y las escenas descaradamente alargadas aburrirán a más de una persona. Como representante oficial del cine lento, esto me parece en realidad un thriller lleno de acción, sinceramente.</td>\n",

Now, &lt;PERSON&gt; is making his feature directorial debut for A24 with Problemista, a hilarious and personal surreal comedy that audiences will absolutely fall in love with.\\n\\nProblemista follows an immigrant (&lt;PERSON&gt;) living in New York City who dreams of becoming a toy designer as he becomes the assistant of an eccentric widow. Although the premise doesn’t sound terribly engaging on paper, there is much more to the story than that in a way that is consistently captivating.\\n\\nOne of the best things about this film is how wonderfully it balances its various styles of humor. Some of the quips will absolutely bring the house down, but almost as funny are the bizarre and idiosyncratic mannerisms of the characters. It’s such a specific, creative sense of humor, and &lt;PERSON&gt;’s unique vision shines through at every moment.\\n\\nThe movie also boasts the impressively quirky and colorful visuals to go along with its humorous tone. From a stylistic standpoint, it feels somewhat reminiscent of what a &lt;PERSON&gt; movie set in the modern-day NYC art scene would look like. There are also plenty of sequences that are wonderfully inventive from a creative standpoint.\\n\\nHowever, even though Problemista thrives in its frequent and subtly deadpan hilarity, it also has a very strong emotional core centered around the protagonist’s experience as an immigrant. Given that the film is clearly semi-autobiographical, with &lt;PERSON&gt;’s own story and emotions informing the movie, it feels tremendously personal and resonates extremely well as a result.\\n\\nThe film’s success also hinges on the complexity of the characters, and &lt;PERSON&gt; does an exceptional job of fleshing out these characters in a way that is so tender and empathetic. Of course, the protagonist is compelling given &lt;PERSON&gt;’s personal connection, but even more impressive is how &lt;PERSON&gt;’s character — who would generally be frustrating and off-putting — is made so approachable.\\n\\n&lt;PERSON&gt;’s performance in the leading role is lovably quirky, but as always, &lt;PERSON&gt; absolutely steals the show in her supporting role. It’s a big, flashy, and exaggeratedly comedic turn from &lt;PERSON&gt;, but it fits perfectly within the context of the movie’s absurd and whimsical tone. &lt;PERSON&gt; and &lt;PERSON&gt; are also fantastically hilarious in some of the most unique supporting roles you will find.\\n\\nProbelmista is a masterpiece — a truly creative vision from a novel voice, and enough that it makes &lt;PERSON&gt; an immediate force to be reckoned with as a director. It comes as no surprise, because his efforts as a writer have been so acclaimed, but his directorial debut is truly extraordinary.\\n\\nProblemista screened at the 2023 SXSW Film Festival, which runs March 10-18 in Austin, TX.\\n\\n- &lt;PERSON&gt;</td>\n",

His unique vision and style, which tend to mix gross out humor with heartfelt sentiment, began in 1994 with Clerks. The cult classic comedy written, directed and produced by &lt;PERSON&gt;, was a passion project, filmed in the very convenience and video store that &lt;PERSON&gt; worked. Now, twenty-eight years later, &lt;PERSON&gt; brings that story to a meaningful and self reflective conclusion.\\n\\nClerks III further explores the mundane, day to day lives of &lt;PERSON&gt; and &lt;PERSON&gt;. As clerks and owners of the Quick Stop Grocery they spend their days engrossed in in-depth conversation about Star Wars. When &lt;PERSON&gt; suffers a near fatal heart attack, it forces him into a state of self reflection.

Despite a budget of around seven million dollars, the film feels small in scale, even more so than Clerks II. &lt;PERSON&gt; brings the third entry back to its shoe string budget, indie roots with a film that feels grounded and tethered to the Quick Stop Grocery’s singular setting. The biggest hurdle for Clerks III is finding a track that allows it to stand on its own two feet without being propped up be the existence of the first two films. There’s a fine line between paying tribute to something, and overly relying on it. &lt;PERSON&gt; tiptoes along that line with an unbalanced trot for the majority of the film, and occasionally, he slips.\\n\\nThere is no doubt about who this movie was made for: The Fans. Clerks III is saturated with call backs and references to the films that came before it, especially to the 1990’s original. So much so, that anybody unfamiliar with those prior films, will likely be lost amidst a whirlwind of weed references and inside jokes and gags. For example, I’ve seen both previous Clerks films. I watched this movie with my wife, whom as not seen either of the first two films. While I was enjoying myself, my wife loudly objected half way through the movie, “This is stupid and I have no idea what’s going on.”\\n\\n&lt;PERSON&gt; knows exactly what he’s doing with Clerks III. He’s making a movie that not everybody will like, but that some will love.

Before I get there I hear a customer. \"Hey you, you're not doing anything make my sandwich\". I reply \"Please give me 1 moment to wipe my face up\". \"NO NOW, IT'S YOUR JOB\". OK you got it lady I am making a sub, side eyed, so not to get sweat anywhere.\\n\\nShe fondant notices the fact that I'm holding my head way back, neck turned, side eye sandwiched along. When I hear \"Ewwww, don't you dare get sweat in my food.\" \"Don't worry ma'am I'm not\". Had she bothered to let me take 20 seconds to wipe my face out wouldn't have been an issue.

If anything, they it just got funnier and more irreverent. It just kept going after the genre--and, perhaps, the subject matter--with its eyes always on the laughs.\\n\\nHulu informed me that this was from the makers of The Naked Gun, and I was a little doubtful.

The sheer overplus of amazing films which keep cropping up in my beloved site is really amazing and I will be eternally grateful for that.\\n\\nSin Nombre is an extremely beautifully shot, Mexican road/ gangster film. &lt;PERSON&gt;’s first directorial venture was a truly enthralling experience. The film is shot entirely in Spanish and the locations vary from several places like, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico.\\n\\nIt is a stark look at the challenging life in Southern America. The film with all its gorgeously choreographed shots of the Mexican country side stunningly contrasts the pitiful plight of the people trying to get a better life than what they were cursed with. I loved the way the film so seamlessly merged the lives of two different people from different backgrounds and how circumstances, their will to do the right thing, the trust they share and their fate take them on a journey which is so hopeless, heart rending and thrilling.\\n\\n&lt;PERSON&gt; who is an American born must have really done lots of homework before the movie and that clearly shows. Not one moment of the film feels like it has been directed by an outsider. Every inch of the film breathes authentic nativity and credit has to go to the director for that. This film will be held proudly as one of their own by all the countries involved and will be surely embedded as one of the best in their film history.\\n\\nI was amazed by the characterisation of &lt;PERSON&gt; who starts out to be a ruthless gangster and then after experiencing the pain of the loss of a loved one examines his wasted life and decides to give it some value, some meaning by doing the right thing even though he has nothing to gain from it. The transformation of his character is so harsh and so real that it immediately strikes a note with the audience’s hearts. &lt;PERSON&gt; so effortlessly captures the widely varying emotions of &lt;PERSON&gt; and nails his role.\\n\\n&lt;PERSON&gt; has done magical things in this film with his camera work. Each and every shot is so beautiful, crystal clear and captures the true essence of the countryside. In fact, it is so good that there could be no better way that each shot could have been planned and executed. Special mention to the train journey the characters take to reach the border. That was poetry on screen. The cinematography just sings here. It is one of the major reasons why the film was such an immersive experience for the audience. No wonder he got the award for best cinematography in the Sundance Festival. No words can do justice to the beauty of this film. Only watching it with all your heart will do that.\\n\\nTo sum up the film is so dark, hopeless and at the same time reinstates faith and belief in the goodness of human life. This is one of the most beautifully shot and directed works I have seen in recent times and an enthralling, sternly harsh, heartfelt film which must be experienced by every film lover.</td>\n",

When the actual sounds of water arrive it's just too much, doubling down on the saccharine and heavy-handed. The text sours as a result, as its poeticism (already rote compared to, say, the work of <PERSON> or <PERSON> post-Benning text explorations in Fainting Spells), feels like it's not disruptive enough. This is to say that the convergence of music and poetry and dance is just too one-dimensional. I want to be invited into this film, to explore the feelings and ideas therein, but <PERSON> is spoonfeeding everything to the viewer. There's a patina of elegance but it only serves as a reminder that each element isn't treated as something expansive, but as a shortcut for vibes.   \n",

It’s the movie equivalent of an unforgettable trick-or-treat haul: the kind you’re rewarded with for risking a visit to that creepy house at the end of the street.\\n\\nFun all the way through, with some genuinely creepy moments, and a black metal loving nerd straight out of a <PERSON> flick. Yes please. And how could you not love a film in which Lovecraftian forces meet their match in a boy’s TOY ROCKET that also represents how hard (but vital) it is to stay friends with your teenage siblings.

Perhaps there’s just not enough Otherness to sweeten the pot for these folk.\\n\\nLook, I don’t think this film is anywhere near as mythic as it sets out to be. The music is mushy and the narration lacks the style and bite required to not turn out hokey (which is especially disappointing since the author himself does the VO).\\n\\nOn the plus side, I can’t fault a single performance. <PERSON> never fails to impress me, <PERSON> was suitably sleazy, and even <PERSON> was convincing.\\n\\nMost of all, between his role in this and The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, grown-up <PERSON> is emerging as one of Britain’s most exciting character actors.\\n\\n<PERSON> is fast becoming a favourite cinematographer of mine, filling a sun-burnt south with painterly shadows. It’s nice to see a Netflix production that isn’t criminally over-exposed.\\n\\nI enjoyed the pacing of the individual scenes yet overall the film felt simultaneously too thin and too long. Can’t help think this would have worked better as a mini series so that the atmosphere could play out more richly and the psychologies of each doomed player could be fleshed out before being buried.\\n\\nMost of all I wish that <PERSON> had directed this.   \n",

I just missed the trend when it became extremely popular. I can see why it's popular, the concept is actually great, this film however is utter trash.\\n\\nA mess from start to finish. I remember seeing that it was originally 3hrs before getting cut down, it's evident right from the start. Just all over the place. I had hopes that maybe the final act would save it, but nope it's laughably bad. It jumps from <PERSON> running perfectly to him then limping as if his legs been sawed off, pretty funny. I wonder if Blumhouse will release an extended or directors cut, that could possibly turn it into a good film for casuals. The big reveal was shite and predictable, and the way it's dealt with it just unacceptable. Like really? That's it? Rushed & ultimately underwhelming.\\n\\nThe animatronics are the highlight, they're fantastic. Real shame they're not in it much. The first 80 minutes is just involves sleeping with some teases of the animatronics. All the characters look brilliant, I understand why they all have a huge fanbase. Couldn't pick a favourite but <PERSON> looked really cool. The film manages to create a pretty decent atmosphere that's worth a mention. Lighting in particular is impressive in many of the diner scenes.\\n\\nI know this is PG-13 in America which is fine, however I have no idea how its a 15 here in the UK. There is no gore or swearing, maybe it's because the overall story with the children but it doesn't go into it enough to justify the rating imo.\\n\\nFNAF does down as a huge wasted potential. The concept is great, but the film does nothing with it. It leaves more questions than answers. Maybe the sequels will be better because they're definitely gonna turn this into a huge franchise with the success it's had. I'm glad that fans had the experience they were looking for. Must have been fantastic for them.   \n",

Eighty-five homes contain a Grandfather Clock he built, 25 of which were prizes at St. Mark’s for their <DATE_TIME> Julifest. His talents also touched the homes of numerous family members and friends. <PERSON> lived but the motto “measure twice, cut once” but there may have been a slip-up here and there! No matter what project he was working on, you could be sure he’d have trouble marking his measurements. That’s because <PERSON> was constantly looking for his carpenter’s pencil.\\n\\nAnd as they say, you can take the boy out of the country but you can’t take the country out of the boy. <PERSON> was living proof of that. <PERSON>, <PERSON> and <PERSON> knew that <DATE_TIME> meant <PERSON> and <PERSON> would be going to “the farm”, usually <PERSON>’s but sometimes <PERSON>’s. And it better not rain <DATE_TIME>, as there was visible disappointment. <PERSON> was certain that sometimes <PERSON> was more concerned about the farm than the owners were!\\n\\n<PERSON> loved being a husband, father, grandpa and great-grandpa. He was always there to lend a helping hand when someone needed it, but he’d never ask for anything in return. He was a quiet leader and set a wonderful example for his family.   \n",

I mean, I´m grateful for every opportunity to rewatch these films. <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON> is what cinematic dreams are made of. I´ve already written a lot about this film, so here is the short version. It´s a tale about human madness, greed, ambition, and colonial hybris dwarfed by a magnificent, uncaring natural world. Immersively filmed like a documentary, “Aguirre, the Wrath of God” is filled with evocative images, an entrancing score, a fever dream atmosphere, and Herzog´s offbeat humor. And <PERSON> stare will haunt me forever.\\n\\nSome random thoughts:\\n-The pan flute player is the equivalent of the musicians in “Titanic”\\n-The ship in the tree is one of the most striking images in Herzog´s career\\n-I wonder if Aguirre´s posture and gait was an inspiration for <PERSON> of <PERSON>\\n\\nHere and here are my previous, more detailed reviews.

It's Me, <PERSON>.\\n\\nI know <PERSON> source novel is beloved by many, and I’m not here to comment on it. The movie adaptation – produced by legendary producer <PERSON>, who came to fame cinematically for Terms of Endearment – indeed feels like it could be a 1980s Oscar Best Picture contender, given it’s about as average, run-of-the-mill Novel Adaptation Cinema as there is, which is to say – it’s OK. There’s nothing remarkable about any aspect of the film; it just exists with <PERSON> (this her second feature) directing her whole crew to averageness. Is it an OK movie that I enjoyed? No, hence the non-passing grade. But it’s not harmful and just… OK.\\n\\nContent-wise, I’m not sure this story has as much impact in 2023 that it would have for kids in the 70s and 80s, with the monotheistic conflict between Christianity and Judaism and the question of the role of God in a middle schooler’s life feeling FAR less interesting now than 50 years ago. So, what I see remaining is an innocuous 100-minute hangout movie with a sixth grader, her eerily overly-happy parents, and some caricature relationships in both her school and extended family.\\n\\n<PERSON> is infectious to watch, for sure, though I’m not sure she’s doing a great performance or just being naturally watchable <PERSON>. Regardless, she’s certainly a high point of the film. <PERSON> is her most interesting in years and young <PERSON> is fine and steady enough. <PERSON> appears to have put in the least amount of effort into his role.\\n\\nIn the end, if one loves the book, there’s a chance nostalgia will win them over with the movie. I, on the other hand, anticipate swiftly forgetting it.   \n",

FUCKING. GOOD. god. so awesome. i am so so thrilled this was not overhyped at all, exceeded my expectations. very easily my new favorite from Yorgos. i forgot until the credits rolled that this is in fact based on a book, and now i need to read it expeditiously - i've heard it's even better. god i really loved this. for starters it's just a visual feast - the colors, the costumes, the sets, THE CAMERAWORK??? rather exquisite. i was so happy about all the fun lenses and such. <PERSON> came across as an amazing character - i always forget just how good <PERSON> is, she was fabulous here. also honestly perhaps the best <PERSON> performance in years. great performances all around though. but yeah i really love <PERSON>. what a wonderful character. her arc is lovely, a really great portrayal of developing an understanding of one's own womanhood and sexuality and how the surrounding world can affect them. despite the obviously fantastical setting and story, the overarching themes regarding growing up and discovering the world, particularly as a woman, felt so realistic to me. i can get why some people are uncomfortable with the sexual aspects of the film - but is that not the point? it surely could have come across a lot worse - i think it was handled rather well to be honest. it's an inherently feminist film. sometimes it does hit you over the head with that just a little bit, but mostly it doesn't and it's just really awesome for me. <PERSON> is kind of sort of an amazing picture of what womanhood feels like to me. she would love Antichrist (2009) btw. actually i found myself throughout the film comparing very small bits and pieces to Antichrist (2009). i feel somewhat similarly about them both in a way. would it maybe be better if a woman was behind the wheel? sure. definitely. but what we got here from Yorgos is still fucking amazing. love love love it. one of the best movies i've seen in a theater in a good while.   \n",

I was working for a well known catering company based out of Maryland. They were contracted to provide servers. There we about 7 of us added to the already 100+ staff working there. The party took place in the Red, Green, and Blue Rooms. There was an area down a set of stairs that people could get their pictures taken with the president and first lady. It was the last party before <PERSON> because president so there was a bit of a sour note in the air. But maybe I'm reading into the fact that this happened in the White House and the out going president was a Republican and the new was a Democratic.\\n\\nMy job was to go around clearing plates left on tables. It was an absolute crush of people. It was buffet style and I don't know if there wasn't enough food to go around or if you could only get food during certain times. I was going around the rooms clearing what I could. I grabbed what I thought was an unattended plate.\\n\\nSome dude(Kevin) then slapped it out of my hand. <PERSON>: That's mine! Me: Sorry, sir I'm just trying to do my job.. (me cradling my slapped hand to my chest with a very shocked look on my face) <PERSON>: Are you a Democrat or Republican? Me: Does it really matter now? <PERSON>'s wife: I'm so sorry! Honey apologize to her! <PERSON>: (Mumbles) Sorry...I wasn't done with it...\\n\\nHis wife looked absolutely mortified as did the two other people in their group. I turned and walked away and avoided that side of the room for a good 20 minutes. When I went back around they were gone...\\n\\nSo yes my hand was slapped for trying to do my job. At The White House!!!\\n\\nIt wasn't funny at the time but it's hilarious now!\\n\\nIf I get enough responses I'll post my interaction with <PERSON>...\\n\\nUpdate: I'm 99% sure it wasn't <PERSON>. I would need to look at a picture of <PERSON> from December 2008. I was more upset that someone struck me while I was working in the White House!\\n\\nMy <PERSON> story is posted   \n",

Too shallow to be the cerebral, spiritual film it’s aiming for, far too baroque for the thrilling blockbuster Disney doubtless asked for when they spent a hundred million US dollars circa 2000 on a movie called “Mission to Mars” based on a theme park ride. In many ways it’s a rote regurgitation of 2001, The Abyss, and Solaris, while simultaneously serving as a foundational urtext for just about every interstellar sci-fi film to come in its wake (<PERSON>’s three 21st century sci-fi films feel particularly indebted to it, though of course each far surpasses it). It’s a work too muddled and muted to truly commend, but too ambitious and earnest not to at least respect. But I wasn’t kidding about that The Abyss shit, the climax of this revolves around <PERSON> discovering he can breathe in an advanced alien liquid. Speaking of, in a principle cast comprised of <PERSON>, <PERSON>, and <PERSON>, God is it unflattering to hitch your wagon to <PERSON> in the leading role.   \n",

Occasionally a card in the equipment went bad. For reference, many of these cards were $100,000US or more. The vendor kept a set of spares onsite, so malfunctioning equipment could be repaired quickly. Her job was to ship the bad card back. They had a 5-day return time; after that, there was a fine / restocking fee of 10% of the card's retail value.\\n\\nThere were two shipment methods, and each had several (expensive) insurance options. Her boss micro-managed his budget and wanted to select the method and insurance each shipment. One day, she stuck her head in his office, and told him she had a card to return. Apparently, he was having a difficult day because he told her to \"just fucking ship it!\".\\n\\nSo, she did. She selected the more expensive shipper and did not specify any insurance.\\n\\nThe karma? This was one of the only shipments in her time with the company that got lost. The shipping company accepted it, billed the company for shipping, and the card was never heard from again. Her boss spent a few hours a day trying to track it down. The shipper's contract with the company limited their liability to a low amount, so they were out a few thousand dollars. <PERSON>' budget took a hit for the replacement cost of the card, but the vendor was nice enough to waive the restock fee. She was not blamed, since there was no standard policy requiring insurance, and the boss said to just fucking ship it.\\n\\n​\\n\\nEdit: For context, this was early '90s. Shipping orders were created on carbonless forms, and \"tracking\" was very primitive. None of this newfangled know where your package is every step of the way stuff.   \n",

He does write the N word into his script so many times, and often it feels like it's there to be shocking (and so he can say it). But here, and in Django Unchained as well, it does have somewhat of a use with showing the time period and the characters in an even less flattering light. But with that said, it can be a bit excessive, and I wouldn't blame anyone for not being comfortable with it. It does have a reason for being here, but I am definitely not someone who should decide if it's necessary.\\n\\nWell, you better shit another pistol out your ass! 'Cause if you don't throw one out here in the next two seconds, we gon' kill this bitch!\\nWith the exception of Kill Bill, every <PERSON> movie I've seen, I've watched at least twice now, and I gotta say that this is easily the most rewarding on a revisit.\\n\\nThe Hateful Eight is... well it's a lot. It's roughly three hours, very slow paced and dialogue heavy, with some of the most unlikable main characters you'll find in a movie. And I'm sure that if I watched it again, this could very well become my favorite <PERSON> movie. It's so twisted and brutal, so mean-spirted and intertwined, but for all the right reasons.\\n\\nRewatching this and seeing the foreshadowing to genuinely surprising twists is great. No character is quite who they first seem, and seeing the events unfold with that in mind is great because a lot of these characters' actions make even more sense under the new contexts.\\n\\nTheres so much in this film that works, even without the clever writing. The set design and music do a great job of developing the environment and creating an entertaining place for the story to be set. The structure and pacing allows you to get settled in to this cabin with the characters and figure out who you should and shouldn't believe and trust.\\n\\nIt's not something I can recommend enough, for any fan of westerns and <PERSON>'s filmography. It's such an entertaining and engaging film, and one that I can't see at least appreciating less the more I return to it.   \n",

Fury of the Gods\\n\\nShazam! Fury of the Gods is a film that would have divided audiences if audiences were interested enough to watch it in the first place.\\n\\nThis is the fifth consecutive financial failure in the DC extended universe of films, which is an unprecedented series of flops for a franchise. It is the sequel to Shazam!, the first film in their five-film-slump, so should we be surprised that no one saw it?\\n\\nThe sequel follows <PERSON>, a teenager who turns into a superpowered adult just by saying the word “Shazam”, and his foster family, all of whom he has given this same power to. When three Greek gods come to Earth wanting the powers of <PERSON>, they have to fight back.\\n\\nThe film had a budget of $125 million, but is estimated to only make an underwhelming $100 million, which is being attributed to poor marketing, poor reviews and a poor performance of the original.\\n\\nWhat was so fun about the first film was watching this kid try and understand his god-like powers and come to grips with this responsibility. The sequel is less fun just because he is an already established hero, and the film barely tries to focus on the civilian aspect of his life, which is what makes this hero so unique.\\n\\nInstead, they just focus on the superhero element of it, which brings nothing new to the table and struggles to set itself apart from the constant barrage of other new superhero films.\\n\\nIt’s definitely not bad at all, but it’s also definitely not fresh. Our cast of heroes headed up by <PERSON> are suitably fun and funny, and overall, the film does have some great comedic moments. It doesn’t take itself too seriously, and that is definitely what was needed.\\n\\nOn the other hand though, the villains are completely forgettable and unimpressionable, although their blandness doesn’t detract from the overall fun flavour of the film.\\n\\nAt two hours and ten minutes, the film does feel like it outstays it welcome, but on reflection, I don’t know what scenes you could cut – to its credit, the film does manage to give every character a moment to shine, so it feels like if you cut any scenes it would diminish the sequel overall.\\n\\nIt’s not the kind of film you can think about for too long without your opinion on it souring, but it’s the kind of film you won’t have any desire to think on after it’s done – it was fun while it was happening, but the second you leave the cinema, you’re bound to forget it.\\n\\nAlthough Shazam! Fury of the Gods was fun, in the future, all this film will be remembered for is a couple good jokes and as a financial failure. This will be used as an example of how not to market a film and nothing else – it was fun and humorous, but overall, it was mostly bland, unoriginal and unimpressionable.   \n",

If The French Dispatch was <PERSON>'s contribution to a genuinely political cinema in the face of an 'apolitical' era, Asteroid City is <PERSON>'s contribution to moving beyond postmodernism, back to an authentic understanding of 'real' and 'unreal.'\\n\\nThis is a film about the selling of plots within plots. <PERSON>'s character \"sells plots\" and is consistently costumed with his green vizor. Green, of course, is associated in cinema with the idea of greenscreen artificiality, and <PERSON> has of course been accused of being over-artificial in the past by numerous critics, including myself. This is really the entire narrative conceit of the film, both the selling of literal plots of land, but also the selling of plots within plots, plots-as-spectacle, fiction as a machine for plot-making, plots as a way of escaping genuine emotion.\\n\\nAnd as my partner points out, <PERSON> smashes his red photographic safe-light when he is finally asked to 'show real emotion,' to 'use his grief,' but even this is fictional. This is made even more complex because in the play-within-the-film structure, <PERSON> comments to <PERSON> that she \"doesn't like beards,\" but outside of the play, <PERSON> doesn't have a beard, but is also not a heterosexual man. Costumes upon costumes upon costumes. Everything is affect, but affect isn't only superficial anymore. <PERSON> cinema is evolving.\\n\\nSo the devil is in the details: the unfinished road, the Native American employee that guards the settlement post-contact, the ellipse from outer space (imposed by what - God? Aliens? The creator Wes Anderson or <PERSON> himself?), the fact that we ride in to Asteroid City on a train (alternate title: Arrival of a Train at Asteroid City), the fact that <PERSON> once again performs the role of 'narrative spokesman' in a <PERSON> picture, the fact that <PERSON>'s character is named <PERSON>, the fact that she shares her name with <PERSON>'s famously-doubled femme fatale from Vertigo, the fact that her 'look' is clearly an amalgam of <PERSON>'s numerous female leads, the fact that <PERSON>'s vizor is green, and more details, too: the red safety light, the fact that both the spaceman and <PERSON> look the same caught on camera, the fact that <PERSON> and <PERSON> only ever view each other through windows, like an audience watching a play, sure, but also like <PERSON>'s Rear Window, which is also a movie about being an audience watching something unfold... this obviously has a lot to do with <PERSON>. It also plays in dialogue extremely well with <PERSON>'s Nope and <PERSON>'s Oppenheimer - two other films about the destruction of deserts, or at least two other films about the destruction of images of deserts.   \n",

You assume they would go around you because you are almost up against the wall and they are taking up a lot of space on the open side. But they don't and have almost crashed into each other so you look up from your phone to see not only are they not going around you, they are not distracted and are looking at you like 'why are you in my way?' At this point it is obvious they will not go around you, a single person taking up minimal space, expecting you to go around them (and the rest of the group have probably stopped as well, meaning you have to go around a large group who have surrounded you for some reason). This happens often to me but seems to happen more often when I am on break and still wearing my uniform.   \n",

Guests were coming in from all over the country. The rooms were assigned by the housing bureau and paid for by their employer. So it had been a crazy night with people finding out they had roommates, a non-smoker had been assigned a smoking room, and two hated competitors assigned to the same room (intentionally done by their boss with notes not to move). One of our last arrivals for this group was a man named <PERSON>. Immediately after <PERSON> checked in he returned to the desk with a young lady in tow. \"There must be a mistake, I'm in a room with a woman I don't know.\" The lady chimes in, \"I'm sure he is a nice guy but staying in a room with a strange man...\" \"I apologize and explained that we didn't assign the rooms. <PERSON> offers to pay for his own room and I explain that we are sold out. There is a hotel on the other side of downtown that has rooms... but of course, all the convention meetings are at our hotel. I do point out that if they can find someone in a single room to switch with I'm more than happy to reassign the rooms. They retire to the bar to figure things out. I later saw them together at the convention's social hour, they approached me and said they would make it work. Could I send up a pair of robes?\\n\\nA year later, I'd forgotten all about <PERSON> and his roommate when I received a call to come to the desk. There at the desk were <PERSON> and his roommate, both with wide smiles on their faces. She was holding her hand up in that way all new brides do. That weekend, a year ago was the start of their whirlwind relationship. They had just gotten married and decided to spend their honeymoon in the city they met in. I helped them plan their sightseeing activities and made restaurant suggestions. They returned for the next two years that I was at that property, the last I heard they had a child on the way and had relocated here.   \n",

Deceptively light for much of its running time, which lays the necessary groundwork for a powerful, poignant final act. Again, like <PERSON>, it feels honest in a way few films do, because it recognizes that our lives are mix of the silly, the funny, the surreal, and the devastating in a way that films more concerned with tonal consistency do not.\\n\\nThe cast is great across the board, but special props to the child ensemble, which is among the best I have ever seen in a film.\\n\\nToo many great moments to go into, and I want to steer clear of spoilers on this one, but one is worth signaling out: when one of her brothers reaches out, grabs <PERSON>'s hand, and slides closer to her. I rarely get choked up at a film anymore; I think I just have seen too many at this point, but that got me, and it is the perfect symbol for the film in microcosm: seemingly simple and understated, but packing a freight train's worth of emotional weight.   \n",

A visitation will be held on <DATE_TIME> from <DATE_TIME> and before Mass on <DATE_TIME> from <DATE_TIME> at Ballard-Sunder Funeral & Cremation, 833 South Marschall Road in <LOCATION>. Mass of Christian Burial will be held on <DATE_TIME> at <DATE_TIME> at the Parish of Saints Joachim and Anne (St. Mark’s Church) in <LOCATION>. <PERSON>’s grandchildren will act as urn bearers, and <PERSON> will be laid to rest with his beloved <PERSON> at Fort Snelling National Cemetery.\\n\\nOn <DATE_TIME> <PERSON> and <PERSON> celebrated the birth of their son, <PERSON>. He would become the middle child of 13. <PERSON> loved growing up on the family farm where developed a strong work ethic that followed him throughout his life. At <DATE_TIME> with his older brothers away at war and his father ill, <PERSON> had to leave school to run the farm. He returned to school when the situation stabilized. <PERSON> left school again as a senior to join the Army as the Korean Conflict was escalating. He was awarded a GED from Jordan High School. He was a dedicated soldier and received high security clearance as a radio operator. <PERSON> was honorably discharged in <DATE_TIME>. But he always remained proud of the fact that of the 13 kids, nine served in the military at some point. He was a longtime member of the VFW and American Legion.\\n\\nWhen he returned to civilian life, <PERSON> attended Brown Institute where he studied radio broadcasting. He received his Radio Broadcast Operator License, but never pursued a career in broadcasting. Instead <PERSON> began working for Continental Machines in <LOCATION>. He was a dedicated employee for <DATE_TIME>. <PERSON> met the love of his life, <PERSON>, in <DATE_TIME> and they exchanged wedding vows on <DATE_TIME>. They settled in <LOCATION> and were blessed with two wonderful children, <PERSON> and <PERSON>.\\n\\nNo matter how busy <PERSON> was, he always made time for the most important things in his life, faith, family, farming and friends. Because <PERSON> was Lutheran, <PERSON> took on primary responsibility for <PERSON> and <PERSON>’s Catholic upbringing. And take it on, he did. <PERSON> practiced and lived his faith as an example to <PERSON> and <PERSON> and was active at St. Mark’s. He was a Lifetime Member of the Shakopee Knights of Columbus Council #1685.\\n\\nOne of <PERSON>’s famous sayings was, “Idle time is wasted time, and wasted time is trouble.” Never one to sit still for very long, <PERSON> always kept busy. He was a very talented woodworker, an interest he picked up from his father-in-law, <PERSON>. Eighty-five homes contain a Grandfather Clock he built, 25 of which were prizes at St. Mark’s for their <DATE_TIME> Julifest. His talents also touched the homes of numerous family members and friends. <PERSON> lived but the motto “measure twice, cut once” but there may have been a slip-up here and there! No matter what project he was working on, you could be sure he’d have trouble marking his measurements. That’s because <PERSON> was constantly looking for his carpenter’s pencil.\\n\\nAnd as they say, you can take the boy out of the country but you can’t take the country out of the boy. <PERSON> was living proof of that. <PERSON>, <PERSON> and <PERSON> knew that <DATE_TIME> meant <PERSON> and <PERSON> would be going to “the farm”, usually <PERSON>’s but sometimes <PERSON>’s. And it better not rain <DATE_TIME>, as there was visible disappointment. <PERSON> was certain that sometimes <PERSON> was more concerned about the farm than the owners were!\\n\\n<PERSON> loved being a husband, father, grandpa and great-grandpa. He was always there to lend a helping hand when someone needed it, but he’d never ask for anything in return. He was a quiet leader and set a wonderful example for his family.   \n",

The usual caveats apply.\\n\\nToday, I shall regale you with stories of miscreants who wished to disavow the damage done to the stately rooms of the <PERSON>, and what their reasonings were.\\n\\n<PERSON> Gentleman and his Lady had been enjoying the libations of our twenty-four hour dramshop, and were in need of slumber. The Gentleman was feeling Quite Exhausted from his time, and hit his head on the commode, damaging it, which is where he slumbered. The Lady had not noticed this, as she had reposed in the bed given.\\n\\nOn the morrow, both awoke to see the damage dealt, and went right to the Innkeep to make sure that their one hundred U.S. dollars would be returned.\\n\\n\"After all,\" They both said, \"was it not your establishment that gave us these libations?\" Alas, their pleas were disregarded; and their U.S. dollars were confiscated for repairs.\\n\\nMiscreant the Second: This Scoundrel had purchased food from a local vendor. Instead of ingesting the delectable items, they chose to smear the contents across nearly every surface imaginable! Walls, curtains, bedding, all fouled with a combination of charred & ground meat, onion, and a mayonnaise/ketchup combination that is legally distinct from the version offered by the Jester McDonald.\\n\\nWhile caught in the act, this Scoundrel was still adamant that they should receive their Deposit back. The reasoning went as this: \"Yes, I smeared my food on most things, but I didn't smear anything on the lampshades.\"\\n\\nAgain, this most thoughtful of pleas fell on deaf ears, and one hundred U.S. dollars was taken from them unfairly.   \n",

By no means does this film deserve to be panned, but it's fairly easy for me to justify my opinion that this was just a middling effort from a filmmaker who's never been one of my favorites.\\n\\nThis isn't a whodunit so much as a will-he-get-away-with-it. But it's still a twisty mystery, one that hews very closely to the original stage play. As a director, <PERSON> was no stranger to shooting in cramped quarters, but he does nothing to open up this story. Bizarrely, the studio -- Warner Bros., I believe -- nonetheless thought this would be a great title to shoot in 3D, which accounts for some of the jarring camera angles we get on occasion.\\n\\n<PERSON> aging London tennis pro knows his wife (Hitch regular <PERSON>) is cheating on him with an American (melty faced <PERSON>), so plots --- and plots and plots --- to have her murdered. That scheme goes awry, obviously --- <PERSON> isn't going to get killed off in the picture's opening reel --- so <PERSON>, lying up a storm, then plots --- and plots and plots --- to frame her for the murder of the man <PERSON> had hired to murder her.\\n\\nPlot is everything here, with all the characters completely subservient to it, although <PERSON>'s camera does fall for <PERSON> in a slinky negligee, in the movie's one truly suspenseful sequence, which is of course the attempted murder.\\n\\nOnce the police get involved, with <PERSON> always niftily three steps ahead of everyone else as the inspector, the suspense gives way to a tortured attempt to keep track of various keys. Before the film was over, I gave up trying.\\n\\nLetterboxd Review No. 781   \n",

Ancak puan ne yazık ki veremiyorum çünkü hakkını sadece puanla verebileceğimi düşünmüyorum. Özellikle sinematografi ve dövüş koreografileri anlamında film oldukça güçlü. Vermek istediği mesajı ve konusunu da gayet sevdim.\\n\\nIt's a real masterpiece in technical terms, in terms of the script and in all its elements. In 1962, if I had the chance to see this in the theater, I would have been glued to my seat. Unfortunately, I can't give it a score because I don't think I can do it justice with just a score. The film is very strong, especially in terms of cinematography and fight choreographies. I also liked the message and the subject matter.   \n",

In fact, that's what makes it sweet and relatable — at least for someone like me who still has college fresh in my mind.\\n\\n<PERSON>, in his omnipresent role in the film, made every annoying film student's dream come true; only he's aware enough of the idiosyncrasy that college is, and doesn't turn this into the most irritating film ever made (which could've been the case altogether).\\n\\n<PERSON> is fantastic, the protagonist's instagram feed featuring one of the saddest scenes of Blue Valentine made me scream, the structure of the first hour made me think of some of the finest <PERSON> and there are a couple scenes that had me crying without warning — so basically what my early 20s were all about.\\n\\nStill liked Cha Cha Real Smooth better, but I'm glad I also watched his first film.\\n\\nSPANISH:\\nLe falta algo de consistencia, pero ¿cómo podría faltarla si la persona que la hizo tenía solo 22 años? De hecho, eso es lo creo que la hace dulce y cercana, al menos para alguien como yo que todavía tiene la experiencia universitaria muy reciente.\\n\\n<PERSON>, en su omnipresente papel en la película, hace realidad el sueño de todo estudiante de cine insoportable; sólo que él es lo suficientemente consciente de la idiosincrasia que supone la universidad, y salva la película de ser algo bochornoso.\\n\\n<PERSON> está fantástica, el feed de instagram del protagonista con una de las escenas más tristes de Blue Valentine me hizo chillar, la estructura de la primera hora me hizo pensar en algunos de los mejores momentos de <PERSON> y hay un par de escenas que me hicieron llorar sin previo aviso — así que básicamente como mi vida con veintipocos.\\n\\nMe sigue gustando más Cha Cha Real Smooth, pero me alegro de haber visto también su primera película.   \n",

I'd never drop a film for a guy.\"\\n\\nFilms about making films are probably my favorite sub-genre of film. Day for Night has always seemed to be regarded as the upper echelon of that genre; the very best you can get out of it. Seeing it today, I wouldn't go that far--mainly because my expectations might've been too high--but it's still a damn good film. It's certainly the most authentic film about filmmaking I've ever seen. This really goes in depth on everything that happens on a film set and everything that goes into filmmaking. Even the little things like getting the right gun for a scene, finding the right cat, etc. All with a bit of entertaining melodrama spliced in between. It all kind of wears thin the more it progresses, but one thing you don't really get tired of is watching how a film comes together in it's production. That alone at least puts it up there with some of the best filmmaking movies I've seen.   \n",

Suddenly, the humans stand a chance against them, as long as they're witty enough. Their guns are suddenly worthy weapons, their speed a match for the creatures. They all have far too much personality now, too much like the humans themselves.\\n\\nThe scary thing about the aliens originally, was the fact that we don't stand a chance.\\n\\nHowever, at least the physical effects and CGI is reasonable in this one. Maybe it's the 4 years that passed between the 3rd one and this one, but I found it a lot more watchable.\\n\\nStill, Alien and Aliens are still the only two movies worthy of being in such a famous and brilliant franchise.   \n",

It was of course that time again, an extra hour, time clock already changed. We are told we work that hour and then when it comes around again we get out an hour early. Okay, I don't trust them, yet really have no choice.\\n\\nI found a better job, I do the right thing and put in a 2 week notice. The main manager, I call her MM, wasn't there. I put my notice into Mr <PERSON> the #2. I'm told he'll tell <PERSON> since she's on vacation currently. I trust him to do his job, this is important later.\\n\\nSo, 2 weeks go by, it's my last day, also happens to be the \"Get out an hour early, day\" right. Nope <PERSON> IS there, \"I never said that\". \"No <PERSON>, Mr <PERSON> said of we stayed that extra hour we get it back now, by leaving an hour early. \" She stares at me, smiled, and says \"If you leave I'll fire you\".\\n\\nNow remember it's my last day. I'm tired, sore, and rather ticked over this hr. So I look at <PERSON> and say \"Well since it's my last day I think I'll just go\". Guess who never told <PERSON> that I put my notice in, yeeeep Mr <PERSON> and she'd been back a week already.\\n\\nHer reply is \"What, you never put your notice into me\". \"I told Mr <PERSON> because you were on vacation. He assured me he would tell you\". She replies \"I was on vacation and he didn't tell me so it didn't count\".\\n\\nBy this point I'm on my way to the time clock, I'm done with this K store. I get my coat, punch out and head for the door. Hearing <PERSON> say \"You'll never work here again!\". Was that supposed to hurt me lmao? However this is important for the next K store story. I'll do that 1 next lol\\n\\nAgain thank you for taking the time to read my story.   \n",

And I gotta say, a lot of the jokes landed.\\n\\nBest for me was the utter lack of an attempt at a \"swing to the serious in the final act\" blunder made by something like 90% of comedies. Nope! If anything, they it just got funnier and more irreverent. It just kept going after the genre--and, perhaps, the subject matter--with its eyes always on the laughs.\\n\\nHulu informed me that this was from the makers of The Naked Gun, and I was a little doubtful. By the end, the fingerprints were unmistakable, especially when it descends into utter mayhem in the final act. This doesn't have the tears of mirth and guffaws I got from those classics, but the laughter was there, and consistently.\\n\\nIf you LOVE those classics... you'll probably like this.   \n",

I ate them both up\\n\\nI work at a fucking donation center but that doesn't matter, people are still assholes.\\n\\nI'm fighting a cold right now, so I'm wearing a mask and gloves in hopes of not getting my coworkers sick. This guy comes by with stuff to donate, and eventually at one point he asks me if I still \"believe in that stuff\" I was too lazy to tell him that I was sick, so I said yes. He asked me why, I say because. Then he says because why? And then I just walk away. Bitch, it's none of your business. I don't need to share my personal choices with you, fuck off.\\n\\nThe other came later in the day. This guy came by with all these loose books. I started taking them for him but politely asked if he could box them or twine them up for me next time. Our donations get picked up daily... we're just a middle man, so we need to have our stuff packed up. Immediately after I ask the guy this he says how he's going to find somewhere else to go... he's gonna tell everyone about this...he asks for my name -i gave him a fake name like I always do..I stopped myself while I was boxing the books up for him and asked if he wanted those books back and he said yes. So I gave them back to him. Lol saved me time. This guy was off the hinge or something <PERSON>   \n",

The sheer overplus of amazing films which keep cropping up in my beloved site is really amazing and I will be eternally grateful for that.\\n\\nSin Nombre is an extremely beautifully shot, Mexican road/ gangster film. <PERSON>’s first directorial venture was a truly enthralling experience. The film is shot entirely in Spanish and the locations vary from several places like, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico.\\n\\nIt is a stark look at the challenging life in Southern America. The film with all its gorgeously choreographed shots of the Mexican country side stunningly contrasts the pitiful plight of the people trying to get a better life than what they were cursed with. I loved the way the film so seamlessly merged the lives of two different people from different backgrounds and how circumstances, their will to do the right thing, the trust they share and their fate take them on a journey which is so hopeless, heart rending and thrilling.\\n\\n<PERSON> who is an American born must have really done lots of homework before the movie and that clearly shows. Not one moment of the film feels like it has been directed by an outsider. Every inch of the film breathes authentic nativity and credit has to go to the director for that. This film will be held proudly as one of their own by all the countries involved and will be surely embedded as one of the best in their film history.\\n\\nI was amazed by the characterisation of <PERSON> who starts out to be a ruthless gangster and then after experiencing the pain of the loss of a loved one examines his wasted life and decides to give it some value, some meaning by doing the right thing even though he has nothing to gain from it. The transformation of his character is so harsh and so real that it immediately strikes a note with the audience’s hearts. <PERSON> so effortlessly captures the widely varying emotions of <PERSON> and nails his role.\\n\\n<PERSON> has done magical things in this film with his camera work. Each and every shot is so beautiful, crystal clear and captures the true essence of the countryside. In fact, it is so good that there could be no better way that each shot could have been planned and executed. Special mention to the train journey the characters take to reach the border. That was poetry on screen. The cinematography just sings here. It is one of the major reasons why the film was such an immersive experience for the audience. No wonder he got the award for best cinematography in the Sundance Festival. No words can do justice to the beauty of this film. Only watching it with all your heart will do that.\\n\\nTo sum up the film is so dark, hopeless and at the same time reinstates faith and belief in the goodness of human life. This is one of the most beautifully shot and directed works I have seen in recent times and an enthralling, sternly harsh, heartfelt film which must be experienced by every film lover.   \n",

When the actual sounds of water arrive it's just too much, doubling down on the saccharine and heavy-handed. The text sours as a result, as its poeticism (already rote compared to, say, the work of <PERSON> or <PERSON> post-Benning text explorations in Fainting Spells), feels like it's not disruptive enough. This is to say that the convergence of music and poetry and dance is just too one-dimensional. I want to be invited into this film, to explore the feelings and ideas therein, but <PERSON> is spoonfeeding everything to the viewer. There's a patina of elegance but it only serves as a reminder that each element isn't treated as something expansive, but as a shortcut for vibes.   \n",

We watch women on a coffee break and the camera remains fixed. After a while the reel runs out and we're left with an imageless screen, and then the image appears again, and then we zoom in. This repeats about five times throughout the course of the film, the interest we gain primarily coming from the way a newspaper will block another's face or looking at them flip through a photo album. But there's little consideration for how this framing is advancing the film in a meaningful way, and when the film ends with a close-up of the coffee with the women all leaving, it feels unearned.   \n",

It’s the movie equivalent of an unforgettable trick-or-treat haul: the kind you’re rewarded with for risking a visit to that creepy house at the end of the street.\\n\\nFun all the way through, with some genuinely creepy moments, and a black metal loving nerd straight out of a <PERSON> flick. Yes please. And how could you not love a film in which Lovecraftian forces meet their match in a boy’s TOY ROCKET that also represents how hard (but vital) it is to stay friends with your teenage siblings. That’s PG-13 horror at its least cynical.\\n\\nIn terms of visual imagination and atmosphere, I can imagine this is the film <PERSON> watched every Halloween. It’s going straight on my annual watchlist too.   \n",

The concept design, the art direction — these are, at times, astounding.

They always admired it, as do I — even after countless viewings.\\n\\nThe Bathtub’s restraint and pathos is even more admirable considering it’s a student film. Back when I was in film school, I was taking big swings which almost always missed.\\n\\nWithin a single unbroken shot, we’re taken through a whole gamut of sibling history: nostalgia, disappointment, tenderness, frustration, acceptance.\\n\\nThe wrestling match between the brothers’ past and present relationship is so built-in to the film’s construction that, on one level, I almost see this as a time travel movie.\\n\\nOK, enough. This review is longer than the film.   \n",

Perhaps there’s just not enough Otherness to sweeten the pot for these folk.\\n\\nLook, I don’t think this film is anywhere near as mythic as it sets out to be. The music is mushy and the narration lacks the style and bite required to not turn out hokey (which is especially disappointing since the author himself does the VO).\\n\\nOn the plus side, I can’t fault a single performance. <PERSON> never fails to impress me, <PERSON> was suitably sleazy, and even <PERSON> was convincing.\\n\\nMost of all, between his role in this and The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, grown-up <PERSON> is emerging as one of Britain’s most exciting character actors.\\n\\n<PERSON> is fast becoming a favourite cinematographer of mine, filling a sun-burnt south with painterly shadows. It’s nice to see a Netflix production that isn’t criminally over-exposed.\\n\\nI enjoyed the pacing of the individual scenes yet overall the film felt simultaneously too thin and too long. Can’t help think this would have worked better as a mini series so that the atmosphere could play out more richly and the psychologies of each doomed player could be fleshed out before being buried.\\n\\nMost of all I wish that <PERSON> had directed this.   \n",

The concept design, the art direction — these are, at times, astounding.

They always admired it, as do I — even after countless viewings.\\n\\nThe Bathtub’s restraint and pathos is even more admirable considering it’s a student film.

There's moments I really like, but also ones I hate. Best thing for me is all the homages and easter eggs, honestly they're outstanding. Literally every few minutes I'm getting excited over something. However, the scenes are then followed by some awful dialogue. The script really let's it down, it's a shame. They describe literally everything you already see on screen. We all know by now these are iconic characters, no need for them to say their whole name every 30 seconds. Right on the nose about it being set in 1998 as well, don't they realise they've already told us? People aren't going to forget.\\n\\nCharacter designs are good, they nail nearly every outfit. <PERSON> with no hat is painful though, maybe I'm being too much of a fan boy. Some character decisions are bad, i hate what theyve done with <PERSON>. Performances are good, they do a good job with what they've been given. We dont spend enough time with each character, so people who arent fans of the games will ultimately not care about their outcomes by the time the final act arrives, this is down to them introducing way too many things for a first film. Cinematography is great, there's loads of lovely shots that I will remember. Atmosphere is on point. Topped off with a good score & soundtrack, could have done without that particular RPD scene tbh.\\n\\nThe film is just a bad mix of old and modern filmmaking. They were so close to doing something great here. I'm giving this 3 stars. I adore all the homages and easter eggs, someone else described it as easter egg the movie, couldn't say it better myself. That combined with the brilliant cinematography cement my rating. On this rewatch I'm even sadder at the wasted potential. This could have been great. I'm probably sitting alone because I still enjoyed it. I'm a sucker for b-movies, zombies, RE & references.   \n",

GOOD. god. so awesome. i am so so thrilled this was not overhyped at all, exceeded my expectations. very easily my new favorite from Yorgos. i forgot until the credits rolled that this is in fact based on a book, and now i need to read it expeditiously - i've heard it's even better. god i really loved this. for starters it's just a visual feast - the colors, the costumes, the sets, THE CAMERAWORK??? rather exquisite. i was so happy about all the fun lenses and such. <PERSON> came across as an amazing character - i always forget just how good <PERSON> is, she was fabulous here. also honestly perhaps the best <PERSON> performance in years. great performances all around though. but yeah i really love <PERSON>. what a wonderful character. her arc is lovely, a really great portrayal of developing an understanding of one's own womanhood and sexuality and how the surrounding world can affect them. despite the obviously fantastical setting and story, the overarching themes regarding growing up and discovering the world, particularly as a woman, felt so realistic to me. i can get why some people are uncomfortable with the sexual aspects of the film - but is that not the point? it surely could have come across a lot worse - i think it was handled rather well to be honest. it's an inherently feminist film. sometimes it does hit you over the head with that just a little bit, but mostly it doesn't and it's just really awesome for me. <PERSON> is kind of sort of an amazing picture of what womanhood feels like to me. she would love Antichrist (2009) btw. actually i found myself throughout the film comparing very small bits and pieces to Antichrist (2009). i feel somewhat similarly about them both in a way. would it maybe be better if a woman was behind the wheel? sure. definitely. but what we got here from Yorgos is still fucking amazing. love love love it. one of the best movies i've seen in a theater in a good while.   \n",

The atmosphere and use of light and shadows are simply impeccable. The film is a visceral experience. It´s eerie, haunting, and deeply evocative, and <PERSON> delivers another banger score. It´s also a fascinating portrayal of the total collapse of a patriarchal society because nobody listens to the one woman who knows what´s going on. <PERSON> and <PERSON> are the greatest screen duo in Herzog´s filmography.\\n\\nHere, here, and here are my previous reviews and here is <PERSON> for his Great Movies selection.\\n\\n<PERSON> movies ranked   \n",

But it's still wildly charming and often hilarious. I particularly liked the <PERSON> cameo red herring. The cinematic dollhouse execution of the train cars is also great, as <PERSON> and long-time DP collaborator <PERSON> take their experience from The Life Aquatic and notably improve upon it.\\n\\nI enjoy this movie *very* much, and it absolutely deserves my heart notch. That said, I'm still refraining from a 4-star \"great\" rating... at least for now. I suspect I'll re-watch The Darjeeling Limited more frequently than other movies I have rated higher.\\n\\nRating increase:\\n3 —> 3.5, plus the ❤️   \n",

FUCKING. GOOD. god. so awesome. i am so so thrilled this was not overhyped at all, exceeded my expectations. very easily my new favorite from Yorgos. i forgot until the credits rolled that this is in fact based on a book, and now i need to read it expeditiously - i've heard it's even better. god i really loved this. for starters it's just a visual feast - the colors, the costumes, the sets, THE CAMERAWORK??? rather exquisite. i was so happy about all the fun lenses and such. <PERSON> came across as an amazing character - i always forget just how good <PERSON> is, she was fabulous here. also honestly perhaps the best <PERSON> performance in years. great performances all around though. but yeah i really love <PERSON>. what a wonderful character. her arc is lovely, a really great portrayal of developing an understanding of one's own womanhood and sexuality and how the surrounding world can affect them. despite the obviously fantastical setting and story, the overarching themes regarding growing up and discovering the world, particularly as a woman, felt so realistic to me. i can get why some people are uncomfortable with the sexual aspects of the film - but is that not the point? it surely could have come across a lot worse - i think it was handled rather well to be honest. it's an inherently feminist film. sometimes it does hit you over the head with that just a little bit, but mostly it doesn't and it's just really awesome for me. <PERSON> is kind of sort of an amazing picture of what womanhood feels like to me. she would love Antichrist (2009) btw. actually i found myself throughout the film comparing very small bits and pieces to Antichrist (2009). i feel somewhat similarly about them both in a way. would it maybe be better if a woman was behind the wheel? sure. definitely. but what we got here from Yorgos is still fucking amazing. love love love it. one of the best movies i've seen in a theater in a good while.   \n",

This took place in the Washington DC area in mid 2000. The hair pulling occurred at the Halcyon House in Georgetown area of DC. I don't know if it's still used for galas, weddings, company & business conference events. It has a very interesting history. It's a house built on a hill with huge underground basement that was used for big events. It has the most amazing view from the back yard of the Georgetown bridge (Fancis Scott Key brigde) that crosses over the Potomac River to the Rosslyn area of Arlington, VA. You can also see the spires of Georgetown University. Apparently it's also haunted.\\n\\nThe event I was working was for an after conference cocktail meet & greet for a paint company. We were serving white & red wine, sparkling water or flat and hors d'oeuvres. It was an absolute mad house. The group had been in a conference all day without much of a break. They were absolutely ravenous. As soon as I'd walk out of the area we were using as a kitchen. I was mobbed by the guests. I wasn't able to walk more than 10 feet before all of the hors d'oeuvres were gone, in less than 30 seconds. I was supposed to walk around the floor and try to get to the other side of the event space. I don't think I ever got to the far side of the space. We actually had to stagger the hors d'oeuvres because the company hadn't paid for enough food.\\n\\nThe hair pulling occurred probably my 3rd time out. I have long curly hair and would wear it in a high braided ponytail. I'm walking out and I feel a tug on my braid. I whip around to a middle aged woman (<PERSON>) with her hand still in the air. She has the most ashamed look on her face!\\n\\nSW: I'm so sorry. I'm just so hungry!\\n\\nMe: You don't need to pull my hair to get my attention.\\n\\n<PERSON>: I haven't eaten anything since breakfast this morning.\\n\\nMe: A tap on the shoulder would have worked just a well.\\n\\n<PERSON> is red in the face and she looks so contrite.

Considered, substantial, and sincere, if hardly exemplary. Nothing short of a miracle for a film adapting a ho-hum prequel to a franchise whose cultural moment ended in 2014. The ensemble cast is wonderful, though I would’ve liked to have seen <PERSON> and <PERSON> given more to work with. Was very happy to see <PERSON> pop up in the third act. <PERSON> continues to be endlessly charming, and her musical performances here were stellar, even more so than her already stunning work on West Side Story. <PERSON> (who I’m obliged to highlight is a <PERSON> alum) feels like an instant star (or would be if we still had those). Very compelling screen presence with a striking look about him. Was shocked at how quickly I got over the role not being played by a digitally de-aged <PERSON>.\\n\\nAt the same time, it’s far too ambitious structurally, leaving the actual Games to feel like a crowd-pleasing stopgap in a more interesting film, and <PERSON>’s direction is too matter of fact to pull off the more expressive aspects of the narrative, especially the ambiguous climax, which he completely bungles. More broadly troublesome though is the inherent abstraction of the franchise’s approach to oppression. I can sympathize with <PERSON>’s belief that The Hunger Games and its derivatives are important for galvanizing the youth into Leftist politics to an extent, but it’s hard to watch this without recalling that one of the key reasons this genre well dried up was the increasingly disquieting relationship between YA dystopias and the actual, recognizable oppression that these works drew from. The Hunger Games’s dystopian world is at once far too tied to the global liberation struggle for much to be mined from it beyond its propagandistic functions, and not nearly literal enough to feel terribly of value at this point. At 4 books, 5 movies, and 15 years of Hunger Games, it feels like we’ve collectively outgrown a need for it. Or at the very least we should have.   \n",

The various business divisions have their own DevOps staffs; we are corporate and own infrastructure.\\n\\nLast month, an App team contacted me. They were failing DR testing due to a single microservice. Unfortunately it was the key microservice. In production it was called hundreds of thousands of times a day.\\n\\nThe app did little logging around this microservice. Pretty much “called with these args, got this response”. Calls were timing out. Since it was timing out and the service was clearly running, it must be a bug in OpenShift, right? (Oh, did I drop this \\s?)\\n\\nStrangely, api calls to the service timeout; the healthcheck calls get through. Oh, wait, it’s failing those healthchecks! App team turns up logging for the service and finds the service is deadlocking. It’s technically not dead, but it’s not answering the phone.\\n\\nI feel vindicated, Apps fixes it, DevOps deploys, and DR passes. Oops, no, it doesn’t. Instead of a timeout, the call fails.\\n\\nI spent two days tracking the progress of the API call. The api is called with a url containing a fully qualified domain name. Working from the outside in, I rule out DNS^1, the cluster’s BigIP, and the cluster’s ingress routers. Each shows the api call entering and leaving.\\n\\nThat leaves the pod containing the service and the node it is running on. More tcpdump- yes, it reaches the node, no it does not reach the pod. The definitions of the components (Route, Service, Pod) are correct. They’re working perfectly in the production namespace on the primary cluster.\\n\\nStumped, I ask a more experienced coworker to look at it. After a few hours he independently verified my results, but was also stumped.\\n\\nI enter a ticket for Red Hat support. I tell them I’m sure I’m overlooking the obvious and need another set of eyes. (Ooh, look foreshadowing).\\n\\nThe next morning my coworker says, “You’re going to laugh…”. As aside that phrase ranks right up with “We need to talk” on the list of things I hate to hear. On our clusters, namespaces (collections of resources) are isolated from each other. You add network policies to describe the traffic you want to allow. There is a set of cluster-wide default policies that make everything work. On our cluster, those policies are copied into the namespace when it is created.\\n\\nMy coworker found that the default policies had been deleted. The namespace contained only a custom policy permitting the DevOps team’s monitoring traffic. Here’s the gotcha: if the namespace has no network policies, the cluster defaults apply. However, if you have any namespace level policies, only those policies apply. The coworker said that’s why we automatically added them when creating a namespace. Adding them back completely resolved the issue. Healthchecks are generated on the same pod, so they’re not affected by network policy.\\n\\nPost Mortem: the first day of testing the app team noticed the service did not respond. In the course of investigating, <PERSON> accidentally (?) deleted the default network policies. The next day, with the problem unresolved they called us.\\n\\n1 Like users I lie. It wasn’t DNS.   \n",

You thought Good Time was the peak of <PERSON> brothers think again because this is how they win.\\n\\nSafdie Brothers have put <PERSON> and <PERSON> on the map, my question is who’s next?\\n\\n<PERSON> gave my favorite performance from 2019 and that he hasn’t gotten more recognition is mind blowing. The range he shows and the way he transforms is unique.\\n\\nThe score is amazing the ambient sounds create the atmospheric pressure within the main leads surrounding.

How the film blends the comedy and thriller genre nearly perfectly, in such a way that I honestly can't compare it to anything else? That the set design, performances, and direction all help craft this beautiful tale of class separation and desperation, aided by the wonderfully layered script, metaphors, and foreshadowing you could easily overlook on the thousandth viewing? Hell, I don't think I've seen a film that will so obviously go down as a classic, and I've still yet to see one top this.\\n\\nIt's honestly not my favorite of the best picture nominees of its year, but that should tell you just how good the nominees were, because I can't find a single reason this shouldn't have won. Parasite is a masterpiece, but if you've spent any time on here, you've heard that countless times before, so instead I'll try to add something that's at least newer than the typical praise: my mom usually cannot stand movies with subtitles, but she watched this tonight because of the legacy it already has, and she's already called it one of her favorite movies.   \n",

Oh, and there’s a 150-foot-tall monster destroying the city.\\n\\nThe age-old struggle of <PERSON> films is filling the gaps between monster fights with interesting human drama. But Godzilla Minus One - the 38th <PERSON> film – does this better than any of its predecessors. Here, the human drama is even more interesting than the incredible <PERSON> action.\\n\\n<PERSON> has always been a metaphor. Sometimes for the threat of nuclear weapons, sometimes of the destruction of war and sometimes the effects of climate change. But <PERSON> has never been a more explicit metaphor than he is here.\\n\\nThe titular monster is a manifestation of guilt, a metaphor of the destruction of Japan, a 150-foot-tall ghost from their past. After <PERSON>’s initial magnificent attack on Tokyo, a group of citizens band together to stop the beast – this film is not about the destruction <PERSON> causes, but about the lives that are left behind.\\n\\nThe love story between the two leads, <PERSON> and <PERSON>, is incredible and emotional, and the backdrop of a terrifying monster levelling a city just makes it all the more tragic. The performances are palpable and heart-breaking as our lead, the defected Kamikaze pilot, struggles with why he is left alive after so many others died in the war.\\n\\nThe human drama is the main draw here, but that does not subtract from Godzilla’s rampages. The scale of the monster’s destruction, the swiftness, the indomitable rage of the Kaiju is enthralling. Music is used sparingly in this film, and the score picks up most excellently in these scenes.\\n\\nThe film looks incredible too, despite having a fraction of the budget that an equivalent Hollywood blockbuster would have. The destruction looks real, and <PERSON> looks menacingly palpable.\\n\\nGodzilla Minus One tackles heavy topic such as the waste of life in war, survivors’ guilt and government mismanagement of emergencies while still working as a threatening action film of trying to stop a monster terrorising a city. The balancing act between these two ideas never seems uneven – this film is as poignant, as it is terrifying, as it is magnificent.   \n",

It's probably the best performances he's wrangled from actors since the early days. This is going to sound bizarre but I kept thinking about how this is kind of like his 'respectable arthouse era' - it's kind of maybe closest to <PERSON> structurally, but much better executed. Like \"people who stand for different ideas all talking in a room with each other\" and in that respect is also a little bit like a <PERSON>-Huillet picture.\\n\\nI recognise that these comparisons are a little ridiculous and overwrought, but the whole film itself functions as a kind of philosophical inquiry or dialogue and I think it's productive to think about the way it functions as a genre-framework version of that.\\n\\nAs far as the way it's photographed, it's probably his flashiest movie since The Happening. It's never 'big' but it's really really 'excessive' formally the whole time lol. I was going wild.\\n\\nThe only minor complaint I have is that I wish it had cut to black about ten seconds before it actually did but I also appreciate that there's a need for the film to ascertain for sure that 'the world beyond those two characters' really does exist and is penetrable so I'm willing to accept it to communicate a bigger idea.\\n\\nI thought the film's queerness was beautifully handled, probably one of my favourite queer films now. Not sure the film itself 'feels queer' but the handling of the queer relationship is really sensitively wrought, which makes sense given that one of MNS' best qualities is his ability to touch on romance and especially divorce in those early pics and that final scene just before <PERSON> is shot is probably the best photography of his career, it's nothing unique to MNS (whereas lots of the rest of the film is incredibly unique), but the 'they're close enough to each other and almost look as if they're about to kiss' functions better here than in any other film I can think of with a similar device.\\n\\nI also think that in this case the PG-13/M rating serves the film really well, it means that violence is photographed in really interesting ways and tends to highlight the action of violence rather than the result, which also operates as an interesting counterpoint to the narrative and philosophical thrust of the dialogue.\\n\\nIt's very slight in everything that it's doing but in some ways that makes the degree to which it is accomplished even more impressive to me. It's not a \"major work\" in the way that, idk, for <PERSON> The Birds is a \"major work\" in terms of scope or for <PERSON> something like War of the Worlds is, it's much closer to a Rope or a Duel or something like that.   \n",

She was staring at me before I even unlocked the door, I still have my bag my coat everything still on, and she was expecting me to serve her right away. I tried to ignore her and entered the store closing the door behind me and start preparing for the day. I was hoping she would get the point that the store was not open yet but she didn't. She continued staring at me until I ran out of things to do and have to tell her that I would not open for 10 more minutes. She seemed to understand but continue to stand there and stare at me. I left the store for 5 minutes while I went to the bathroom, hoping that she would leave. But as I was walking back I noticed that she was actually standing at the corner waiting for me, like she couldn't believe I left her hanging. As I was opening the door to go back inside and try to ignore her she told me her order. I still was not open yet but she didn't care. I told her to wait but she pulled out her card and stood at the till staring at me. When opening time rolled around and my delivery still had not arrived I told her that it would be a bit late and she got mad at me. She told me to call the driver, I told her that he wouldn't pick up because he was driving and she continue to berate me for lying to her. When delivery came in she told the driver that she was waiting. I served her as soon as I could just to get rid of her. After she paid she told me I should say sorry. It's not like I could control traffic. I told her the information as I knew it and that stuff like this was out of our control. About starts to a bad day and it was only getting worse... 😩   \n",

Fine, I will!\\n\\nI started working at a hotel in the engineering department in the early 2000s. Because I had some computer experience, I naturally became the onsite tech guy. Four years go by and I have given two months' notice, tired of 12-hour days doing my job plus cobbling together outdated IT for a manager who disliked me. Two months nearly went by with me repeatedly asking my manager (AGM) who was going to be taking my place so that I could train them. With two days left they asked me to train six individual managers on how to manage/maintain the computer systems in their departments.\\n\\nI lived three blocks from the hotel and after I left I would stop by on occasion for a drink or just to say \"Hi.\"On one of my stops, the Front Desk manager commented that he had not done a system backup since I left because he couldn't remember the steps. I went behind the front desk so I could show him, again. A couple of days later my old manager called, while reviewing tapes he'd seen me behind the desk. He informed me that under no circumstance was I to be in hotel work areas, yelling \"You don't work here anymore!\" followed by a slamming of the phone.\\n\\nOne year after I left the hotel I received another call from my old manager, I ignored it. I'm busy doing a full renovation at my new hotel. The next day I received additional calls from my old General manager who I actually liked. When I return the calls I find out the Front Desk manager who I'd trained was fired weeks after my last encounter. The IT system had failed and no backups were done since the one I did. They needed help... I declined. Gossip has it the AGM was fired with this situation being the main cause. They had to contact corporate and spend tens of thousands of dollars and a full weekend to retrieve/rebuild the lost data.   \n",

His cynicism feels as much like an act, a gambit to \"make it\" in a society that moved on from quaint notions of duty and obligation when he came back from the war. Some great camerawork here as well, particularly in the set pieces surrounding the titular carousel.\\n\\nThat central premise of a disillusioned ex-soldier going after a war profiteer also sets it apart, making it, for my money, fit in with the Film Gris movement. It definitely does have a political spin, criticizing post-war American capitalism and setting it up against the more communal Mexican-American culture we see in the film.\\n\\nIt is the portrayal of Mexican-Americans where it will perhaps slip up for some. <PERSON> is great as <PERSON>'s guide here, but she is also playing the role in brown face, and could come off as the stereotypical, helpful Mexican girl (much of the same could be said for <PERSON> <PERSON>). Mileages will vary, but for me it mostly steers clear of this problem because the actors bring so much life to their roles, and the script gives both room to breathe. They feel like real people, rather than props for <PERSON>'s story (in fact, <PERSON>'s final moments, besides being delightful, suggest not only that she has gone through an arc as well, but that the story is really hers not his.\\n\\nAnyways, loved it. It would make a great double bill with Fuller's Pickup on South Street, which takes similar themes in much more venomous directions.   \n",
       "35  In life, <PERSON> was calm, generous with his time for others, and acted according to an inner beat composed by the graces of both a jesting bard and a gentleman.

All those who shared in <PERSON>’s life, from family to friends to acquaintances, knew the same unassuming man filled with these qualities and a love unbounded by the material world. He was of rare stuff indeed.\\n\\nThe eldest of three children, <PERSON> grew up in a household teeming with laughter, animals and the smell of freshly baked cookies. At <DATE_TIME>, his first motor vehicle incident occurred while driving his grandparent’s sedan into a refrigerator. The refrigerator works to <DATE_TIME>; the car does not. At <DATE_TIME>, he made his first of thirty <DATE_TIME> fall trips to his great grandfather’s farm near <LOCATION>, <LOCATION> with his father hunting waterfowl. <PERSON> spent much of his free time in youth on a baseball diamond, football field, hockey rink, or neighborhood front yard in pursuit of the next great play.\\n\\nAs an active member of the Shepherd of the Lake Lutheran Church youth group, <PERSON> traveled with an assemblage of friends under the leadership of <PERSON> on numerous trips to <LOCATION>, hiking and skiing in <LOCATION> through the <LOCATION>, to <LOCATION>, <LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>, <LOCATION> and <LOCATION> on Habitat for Humanity projects.

He graduated from the Prior Lake High School in <DATE_TIME> and punctuated <DATE_TIME> of schooling by jumping out of a plane.\\n\\nAfter high school, <PERSON> worked the culinary gamut from The Ground Round to Timberlodge Steakhouse (the place where the (in)famous “Goonies” cadre began their ‘magical friendship’) to <PERSON>’s. Between these job stints, he set off to <LOCATION> in his pickup ‘The Black Dog’ living on a harbored sailboat for <DATE_TIME>.\\n\\nAs an avid Minnesota Gophers fan, <PERSON> loved attending football games with fellow maroon and gold supporters as part of the group, DTTG (Dinkytown Tailgating). Through <DATE_TIME>, camaraderie, communion, and the personal connections made and developed between a large and diverse network of friends remained <PERSON>’s most valued asset. Their friendship meant more to him than words can possibly convey.\\n\\nAn excellent chef, <PERSON>’s specialties included Mexican and Italian cuisine, deep-dish pizza, and BBQ smoked ribs. During <DATE_TIME>, he spent valued time in his flower and vegetable gardens growing tomatillos and tomatoes and tending to hostas, herbs and especially his dianthus.\\n\\nIn <DATE_TIME>, <PERSON>’s world fundamentally changed when he met a young woman named, <PERSON>. The focus of his eyes, his words, and his deeds would forever be orientated in a new direction towards a sun-strewn horizon. On <DATE_TIME> at the Hurley Presbyterian Church in <LOCATION>, <LOCATION>, <PERSON> and <PERSON> exchanged wedding vows and united in holy matrimony.

As is typical, I am at a bar pretending while I silently type this out that it counts as \"not drinking alone\".\\n\\nA while back, we had a guest who was getting heated with one of my agents. I didn't know what it was about, but I went up to remove my agent from the situation. After all, they don't get paid for that.\\n\\nThe guest was trying to get access to a room using a Costco card. For those who may be unfamiliar, this is a card that allows access to a wholesale store, which does have the guest's picture on it. Still not legal ID, obviously. No dice.\\n\\nI try to explain that we need legal ID, and he gets even more aggressive. \"I'm a VIP with the group that's in, you need to accept this!\"\\n\\nI tell him that we need legal ID, and his argument was that this WAS legal. I mentally sighed, because I have heard that argument before. Still, I have a standard response to this after my many experiences.\\n\\n\"Sir,\" I say, \"If the police asked for your ID, and this was the card you produced, do you think they would take it?\"\\n\\n\"It doesn't matter, you're not the police!\" He yells. To which I point out that I do have a duty to uphold the law, which does require legal identification.\\n\\nWhile I am having the argument, I am still working on looking up his room. Sure enough, the room he is associated with was a VIP room- and he is the additional guest. He's not the VIP, he's the guest of the VIP. With this, I have an out.\\n\\nI tell him that I will simply contact the VIP themselves, and they could come down and straighten this out.\\n\\nHe glares at me, reaches into his wallet, and pulls out his ACTUAL Legal ID. He had it the whole time, he just didn't want to use it for whatever reason. Key was made, took 10 seconds.\\n\\nAs I handed him his key I said, \"See, that wasn't hard for any reasonable person, now was it?\"\\n\\nIf looks could kill, I would have been mildly stunned.   \n",

So I'm now revisiting this film trilogy, and remaining open to re-evaluation.\\n\\n<PERSON> was clearly a good choice to helm these movies. He brought ample resources to bear, made great use of all those New Zealand locations, and most importantly, was steadfastly loyal to the source works. This first installment does a very good job at setting the stage and establishing mood. The stakes couldn't be higher, and the sense of foreboding is crushing (those Nazgul riders are most effective).\\n\\nBut, too crushing? My only criticism that really carries through from the early 2000s to today is that <PERSON> frequently overdoes it. He gets carried away. His roots as a horror director show in the design of the orcs, the Uruk-hai, even the <PERSON>, along with all the over-the-top stuff to do with <PERSON>, although I think the Bridge of Khazad-dum sequence rocks.\\n\\nI used to be of the opinion that this and the next two pictures weren't really acting showcases, but I take that back to some extent. I was especially impressed here by the command of <PERSON> as <PERSON>. Great role, great performance. <PERSON> is utterly convincing as <PERSON>. But I'll stop there.\\n\\nI remember enjoying \"Fellowship\" considerably more than the next two films, so I'll be interested to see if that holds.\\n\\nSide note --- As a film journalist I did press for all three \"LOTR\" pictures back in the day, interviewed seemingly everyone involved, and New Line showered us with tons of awesome swag. I don't know where it went, but I have none of it today, and you can't find that stuff online anywhere. Makes me sad.\\n\\nLetterboxd Review No. 769   \n",

Özellikle yarattığı kendine has dünyasını ve bazı aksiyon sahnelerini epey sevdim. Ancak anlattığı hikayesi bazen çiğ bir tad verebiliyor ve o kadar ilgi çekici bir malzeme bulamayabiliyorsunuz. Yarattığı dünyasına karşılık zayıf kalmış senaryosu ne yazık ki filmi çok baltalamış. <PERSON> versiyonunda daha iyi sahneler izleyebileceğimizi az da olsa düşünüyorum. Birde şu <PERSON> alakasız yerlerde ağır çekim kullanma hastalığından acilen kurtulması lazım. <PERSON> aksiyon sahnelerini bile baltalıyor ne yazık ki. Günün sonunda fena olmayan bir dünyaya sahip, ortalama bir aksiyon bilim kurgu filmi. <PERSON> sinema evrenine yakışır cinsten.\\n\\nRebel Moon is not as bad as I expected it to be, with its wonderful world, <PERSON> shooting style, a script that sometimes drags and a pace that keeps you alive every minute. I especially liked the unique world it created and some of the action scenes, but the story it tells can sometimes taste raw and you can't find that much interesting material. Unfortunately, the weak screenplay in spite of the world it created undermined the movie a lot. However, I think we will be able to watch better scenes in the extended version. Also, <PERSON> needs to urgently get rid of this disease of using slow motion in irrelevant places. Unfortunately, it sometimes undermines even the action scenes. At the end of the day, it's an average action sci-fi movie with a not bad world. It's worthy of <PERSON> cinematic universe.   \n",

I think I LOVED this thing. I observe TÁR, as many others — I presume, or at least hope so, to not feel stupid — like an outsider. I listen to, and appreciate, classical music, but I'd never be able to put into words, or even comprehend for that matter, the celestial sublimation music can take you to.\\n\\nCinema, however, usually takes me there, and <PERSON> approach to abuses of power in the Me Too era is riveting in its quietness. Ever innovative and bold, the film explores the validity of art and intellectuality, never forcing a simplistic take to drive the narrative forward. What elevates TÁR then is how it's entirely framed as an intimate character study, and in doing so making the whole issue universal. We are participants of the protagonist's brilliance and lies, her mastery and self-deceptions, and ultimately of her crooked vision of the world.\\n\\n[Enters <PERSON>]:\\nAs confirmed by <PERSON> himself, the film was written with her in mind; and it is easy to see why. If there was anyone who could pull off those lines without sounding absolutely ridiculous, that was <PERSON>. I've seen her do it all, from the extreme tenderness of <PERSON> to the shocking brutality of what she accomplishes here. I keep trying to think of another performance that might resemble her work in this film, but it keeps eluding me.\\n\\nAs it's often said: not a film for everyone. I'm sure the slow pace and unabashedly elongated scenes will bore more than one. As an official representative of slow cinema, this was actually an action-packed thriller, to be honest. A film I'm very sure I'll keep getting back to.\\n\\nSPANISH:\\nCreo... Creo que me ENCANTÓ esta \"cosa\". Observo TÁR, como muchos otros — supongo, o al menos eso espero para no sentirme estúpido — como un extraño. Escucho y aprecio la música clásica, pero nunca sería capaz de expresar con palabras, ni siquiera comprender, esa sublimación celestial a la que puede llevarte la música.\\n\\nEl cine, sin embargo, suele llevarme ahí, y el enfoque de <PERSON> a los abusos de poder en la era del Me Too es fascinante en su aparente silencio. Siempre innovadora y valiente, la película explora la validez del arte y la intelectualidad, sin forzar nunca una visión simplista para hacer avanzar la narración. Lo que eleva a TÁR es cómo se enmarca por completo dentro de un estudio íntimista del personaje principal, y al hacerlo convierte el tema en universal. Somos partícipes de la brillantez y las mentiras de la protagonista, de su maestría y sus autoengaños y, en última instancia, de su torcida visión del mundo.\\n\\n[Enters <PERSON>]:\\nComo confirmó el propio <PERSON>, la película se escribió pensando en ella; y es sencillo entender por qué. Si había alguien que podía interpretar esos diálogos sin parecer absolutamente ridícula, esa era <PERSON>. La he visto hacer de todo, desde la extrema ternura de <PERSON> hasta la impactante brutalidad de lo que consigue aquí. Y por más que intento pensar en otra actuación que pueda parecerse a su trabajo en esta película, se me escapa.\\n\\nComo suele decirse: no es una película para todo el mundo. Estoy seguro de que el ritmo lento y las escenas descaradamente alargadas aburrirán a más de una persona. Como representante oficial del cine lento, esto me parece en realidad un thriller lleno de acción, sinceramente.   \n",

A young man so closely attached and familiar with that suburban lifestyle is fascinated--like an obsessive, yet innocent perversion--and desperately wants to understand what that dangerous, violent shade of life is like, but he can never know unless he confronts that lifestyle head on. When he finally does, he isn't ready. He could never be ready for the venomous, ugly scenes that lie beyond a white picket fence.\\n\\nThere's also a bunch of awkward sex, <PERSON> high out of his mind, and a chicken walk. This movie's fucking weird.   \n",

There's just something amazing about a well written, well performed coming of age drama.\\n\\nThis is a perfect example of a film that completely and accurately captures the bonds and frictions between families, friends and lovers. It demonstrates the trials of growing up, of your first love, the social awkwardness of fitting in.\\n\\nThe performances are perfect, the soundtrack is spot on, and the script is amazing.\\n\\nBasically, The Way, Way Back is nothing short of wonderful.   \n",

Now, <PERSON> is making his feature directorial debut for A24 with Problemista, a hilarious and personal surreal comedy that audiences will absolutely fall in love with.\\n\\nProblemista follows an immigrant (<PERSON>) living in New York City who dreams of becoming a toy designer as he becomes the assistant of an eccentric widow. Although the premise doesn’t sound terribly engaging on paper, there is much more to the story than that in a way that is consistently captivating.\\n\\nOne of the best things about this film is how wonderfully it balances its various styles of humor. Some of the quips will absolutely bring the house down, but almost as funny are the bizarre and idiosyncratic mannerisms of the characters. It’s such a specific, creative sense of humor, and <PERSON>’s unique vision shines through at every moment.\\n\\nThe movie also boasts the impressively quirky and colorful visuals to go along with its humorous tone. From a stylistic standpoint, it feels somewhat reminiscent of what a <PERSON> movie set in the modern-day NYC art scene would look like. There are also plenty of sequences that are wonderfully inventive from a creative standpoint.\\n\\nHowever, even though Problemista thrives in its frequent and subtly deadpan hilarity, it also has a very strong emotional core centered around the protagonist’s experience as an immigrant. Given that the film is clearly semi-autobiographical, with <PERSON>’s own story and emotions informing the movie, it feels tremendously personal and resonates extremely well as a result.\\n\\nThe film’s success also hinges on the complexity of the characters, and <PERSON> does an exceptional job of fleshing out these characters in a way that is so tender and empathetic. Of course, the protagonist is compelling given <PERSON>’s personal connection, but even more impressive is how <PERSON>’s character — who would generally be frustrating and off-putting — is made so approachable.\\n\\n<PERSON>’s performance in the leading role is lovably quirky, but as always, <PERSON> absolutely steals the show in her supporting role. It’s a big, flashy, and exaggeratedly comedic turn from <PERSON>, but it fits perfectly within the context of the movie’s absurd and whimsical tone. <PERSON> and <PERSON> are also fantastically hilarious in some of the most unique supporting roles you will find.\\n\\nProbelmista is a masterpiece — a truly creative vision from a novel voice, and enough that it makes <PERSON> an immediate force to be reckoned with as a director. It comes as no surprise, because his efforts as a writer have been so acclaimed, but his directorial debut is truly extraordinary.\\n\\nProblemista screened at the 2023 SXSW Film Festival, which runs March 10-18 in Austin, TX.\\n\\n- <PERSON>   \n",

To say that <PERSON> has a dedicated fanbase would be an understatement. The filmmaker has been bringing quirky comedy to the masses for nearly three decades. His unique vision and style, which tend to mix gross out humor with heartfelt sentiment, began in 1994 with Clerks. The cult classic comedy written, directed and produced by <PERSON>, was a passion project, filmed in the very convenience and video store that <PERSON> worked. Now, twenty-eight years later, <PERSON> brings that story to a meaningful and self reflective conclusion.\\n\\nClerks III further explores the mundane, day to day lives of <PERSON> and <PERSON>. As clerks and owners of the Quick Stop Grocery they spend their days engrossed in in-depth conversation about Star Wars. When <PERSON> suffers a near fatal heart attack, it forces him into a state of self reflection. He begins to ask, “What have I done with my life?” With a newfound lease on life, <PERSON> sets out to make a movie about his life and the customers he interacts with everyday. <PERSON>, <PERSON> and <PERSON> are along for the ride, as always.\\n\\n<PERSON> <PERSON>’s signature style. Despite a budget of around seven million dollars, the film feels small in scale, even more so than Clerks II. <PERSON> brings the third entry back to its shoe string budget, indie roots with a film that feels grounded and tethered to the Quick Stop Grocery’s singular setting. The biggest hurdle for Clerks III is finding a track that allows it to stand on its own two feet without being propped up be the existence of the first two films. There’s a fine line between paying tribute to something, and overly relying on it. <PERSON> tiptoes along that line with an unbalanced trot for the majority of the film, and occasionally, he slips.\\n\\nThere is no doubt about who this movie was made for: The Fans. Clerks III is saturated with call backs and references to the films that came before it, especially to the 1990’s original. So much so, that anybody unfamiliar with those prior films, will likely be lost amidst a whirlwind of weed references and inside jokes and gags. For example, I’ve seen both previous Clerks films. I watched this movie with my wife, whom as not seen either of the first two films. While I was enjoying myself, my wife loudly objected half way through the movie, “This is stupid and I have no idea what’s going on.”\\n\\n<PERSON> knows exactly what he’s doing with Clerks III.

I enjoyed serving people, helping them. I was raised that way. Most people were nice, concert nights were always the worst. You get hot around all those streaming tables. You are going to sweat! I always tried to take the time to switch out positions so I could take care of the sweat. Nobody wants seat in their food, nor even me.\\n\\nIt was a concert night, people get drunk, entitled, and stupid. I'm running aid being as many as I can. Making sure my coworkers are not overwhelmed. Casino employees are crazy in the first place lol just like me I fit in. Anyway, I start sweating, I try to exit to the back to wipe my face. Before I get there I hear a customer. \"Hey you, you're not doing anything make my sandwich\". I reply \"Please give me 1 moment to wipe my face up\". \"NO NOW, IT'S YOUR JOB\". OK you got it lady I am making a sub, side eyed, so not to get sweat anywhere.\\n\\nShe fondant notices the fact that I'm holding my head way back, neck turned, side eye sandwiched along. When I hear \"Ewwww, don't you dare get sweat in my food.\" \"Don't worry ma'am I'm not\". Had she bothered to let me take 20 seconds to wipe my face out wouldn't have been an issue. Seriously lady????   \n",

I'm nothing if not openly proud of my mom's newfound appreciation for horror films in her 60s, but Mr. <PERSON> is absolutely not something she would like to experience. So we pivoted!\\n\\nGiven the WILDY divergent ratings for this one, I had no idea what to expect. I ended up impressed! I wasn't sure I loved what Mr. <PERSON> was doing at first, but it really grew on me. Likewise Belfi was an excellent casting decision, and for huge swaths of the film, the two of them gave what easily could have been a two-person play, and would have worked just as well in an audiobook.\\n\\nWithout giving too much away, perhaps my favorite aspect of the film is it was so gentle when dealing with every character except [X]. It really gave the individuals depth and emphasized their humanity, which--of course--was the whole point.   \n",

Dour aesthetics rendered with algorithmic and thematic consistency, layered across an expansive, Randian runtime that conquers the viewer's world like an invading army of Joe Rogan Experience subscribers who have accidentally and improbably been granted the power of mind control. Fascinating as a corporate object and nothing else, and the crowning example of teeth-chattering fanboy propitiation that began with Snakes on a Plane (2006) and ends at the precise moment the words \"This film is presented in a 4:3 format to preserve the integrity of <PERSON> creative vision\" appeared as center-justified pixels on your screen. Less interesting as an illustration of what can be accomplished, entertainment-wise, with the absolute top tier of 20th-century corporate IP — a collection of characters who have the long-unfulfilled potential to elicit joy, inspire awe (not pummel it into your skull), and make the audience believe a man can fly — which, honestly, is a fucking shame. That this movie requires a macro lens to capture what is most worthwhile about it (unanswered questions of creative provenance, industry precedents, platform innovation, and behind-the-scenes drama) is an intergalactic crime against what the public ostensibly deserves, which is a <PERSON> movie that allows Earthlings to love the character with unreserved sincerity. Talk at me for however long you want, but I can tell that I share absolutely nothing, mentally, with the type of person who watches even a minute of this and feels impressed or satisfied.

What the f?\\n\\nSo two things.\\n\\nMy coworkers and I just got a text ... from our manager, saying going forward, our schedules will be made a month in advance, and that if we want to request time off, we need to give a month's advance notice, which ties in to the next issue-\\n\\nIf we can't get to work, if something comes up, we need to get it covered by someone.\\n\\nI asked my supervisor about it, she's cool, she said it's a new thing from corporate. I asked, isn't it management's responsibility to find coverage and apparently our company doesn't think so.\\n\\n..Am I missing something here?   \n",

What do scientists do? Come up with some new radical idea which causes a revolution in their particular field. It is the same with Pixar. Toy story created a revoution in terms of the animation technology shown on film, and also the depth of story telling and the plethora of new ideas explored in an animated film.\\n\\nMaking toys talk, thinking like a toy, what he likes, what he fears etc in Toy story 1,2,3 , Getting into the mindset of a rat who wants to be a chef in Ratatouille , Thinking like a robot in a different planet in Wall-E, Thinking like a fish, a shark, sea turtle and as every possible creature under water in Finding Nemo, Thinking like a Monster in a world where screams of terrified little children generate Electricity in Monster's Inc( That idea was btw truly Awesome), Thinking like a car and constructing a world entirely inhabited by cars in Cars.\\n\\nAren't they radical, aren't they inspiring ideas which no one has ever thought about before? They sure are.\\n\\nIf there were nobel prizes given for the field of film-making, then people in Pixar would grab so many and their first and the most dearest Nobel would be for their first child TOY STORY.   \n",
