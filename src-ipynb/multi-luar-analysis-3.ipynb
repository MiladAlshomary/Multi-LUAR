You never empathise with him, but you do not hate him. It always has stricken me that the &lt;PERSON&gt; is a product of his own environment. NYC is the villain, the enabler. The drugs, the gambling, the scum, the darkness, the violence, all just naturally exists around him and he is just a part of the city’s routine. He cannot break free of its immoral, corruptive nature. He is bound to it.\\n—\\n&lt;PERSON&gt; contrasts innocence with depravity. The lieutenant drops his kids to school and takes a hit straight after. He wakes up the next day next to a toddler, still wasted from the night before, the drug dealer shown trying to make ends meet for his family and the nun is corrupted. Despite being such a cynical film, I believe &lt;PERSON&gt; tries to shine glimpses of hope on his city.\\n—\\nThe film doesn’t really stop. It’s scene after scene of some misdeed, mistake or wrongdoing. It literally doesn’t stop gambling, drinking, destroying, or drugging. Neither does the lieutenant. Neither does New York. It’s a fast track to destruction in one way or another. There’s no escape. It never seems like his redemption is possible until the very end but by then it’s too late. The nightclubs, shootings, drugs, stack on top of one another, an evil momentum constantly building, and &lt;PERSON&gt;’s soaring use of music enhances this build up all the more. You feel doomed from the very start.\\n—\\nFerrara is fascinating in so many ways. This is his peak shit, and one of my all time favourite movies. It genuinely blows me away every time I see it. Underrated.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Killer\\n\\nFun and stylish, mostly. The voiceover, particularly in the first act, reeked of simply not trusting the audience; A version of this opening playing with no dialogue would have been a stone-cold classic. &lt;PERSON&gt; is pretty good here, and when she shows up, the scene with &lt;PERSON&gt; is fantastic.\\n\\nI think people are overstating the politics a bit, or, rather, the politics are definitely there, but it is also basically just a rehashing of the politics of the &lt;PERSON&gt; franchise. It uses the killer-for-hire setting to comment on how an elite have increasingly insulated themselves from average citizens, and how they expect to play by different rules than those beneath them, freely changing the rules and agreements to suit their own agendas.\\n\\nStill, it is enough fun (and funny; the killer is pretty bad at his job sometimes!) that I think this would have been a four for me until the ending. But why he let the billionaire live after killing people much, much less culpable was frankly baffling to me. Thematically, I guess you could say that is a comment on who is above consequences too, but again &lt;PERSON&gt; is better at this. Here there's no real reason why he can't just kill the client, so for me it breaks the plot. Some lipservice is paid that the cops would investigate it more seriously since he was rich, but honestly the target at the beginning seemed pretty well off too; and are we to believe he never killed any wealthy or high-profile people? Why wasn't it a concern previously?\\n\\nIt left me with a bad taste in my mouth, which is probably the point, but I think &lt;PERSON&gt; got lazy in doing the heavy lifting that would have made the thematic point he wanted to make make narrative sense.</td>\n",

You're hired in, pay is decent, working remote - in my case, \"you'll be taking about 14-20ish calls a day, waiting around watching Netflix\" this is the life of a claims adjuster.\\n\\nWell, needless to say : Not the case.\\n\\nFast forward two years.\\n\\nI'm now a team lead for customer service, with the ability to jump in and handle claims. If it's not one thing it's another, but I do enjoy my job. I get to fix people's screw ups and help assist contract holders, and answer questions and whatnot. Aside for the job having it's pros and cons, it appears the \"higher ups\" always have their priorities in line.\\n\\nAvailability time.\\n\\nMy job requires me to remain available to perform it, and unfortunately..if I were to remain available, I'd be non-stop taking claims calls, then being asked questions between calls from customer service..taking \"supervisor\" calls (don't even get me started), all at once. Overall, too much.\\n\\nOne of my coworkers was on the chopping block because of high \"unavailable\" times, and it was made known he needed to fix it. Unfortunately he decided to leave because he felt like he couldn't do his job and got sick of the email threats from our manager.\\n\\nWell, less than a week later: I got that email. 80% unavailable time. Keep in mind, I am working. Fixing other people's claims and getting them authorized, addressing dissatisfied customers concerns and either putting a stop to them or assisting as much as possible. I am, in theory..a supervisor, but paid significantly less, as my title is a \"hybrid\" - team lead for customer service and a claims adjuster.\\n\\nAppears to me that all companies that follow metrics almost militantly, are either upset you're too available, too unavailable, etc.\\n\\nI'll be honest, I'm a foot out the door. I already know what's coming and I made it apparent to my manager that this whole issue goes against me taking the team lead position.\\n\\nI basically was met with \"my hands are tied, not my problem, adhere to it or you'll get warnings\" etc.\\n\\nAnyone else experiencing this?</td>\n",

       "      <td>Dogs have feelings too.\\n\\nWhat I learned from thinking about my dog's feelings, and my advice to you\\n\\nContext: My dog &lt;PERSON&gt; is a sweetheart, but he has extreme separation anxiety. He was also adopted from my mother-in-law, whose ex-fiancee fed him whatever human food he was eating himself at the moment. Because of these two things, &lt;PERSON&gt; is a very needy and vocal dog, and it can be frustrating to navigate his wants and desires as they often feel like an inconvenience.\\n\\nI felt this way about &lt;PERSON&gt; for our first two years together; however, I had a huge epiphany when I came across animals who use assistive communication devices such as Ellie the Cockatoo and &lt;PERSON&gt;.\\n\\nThe Revelation: The animals who are trained to communicate using iPads and buttons with speakers have fundamentally changed the way I understand animals' consciousness. They are able to express when they are sad, mad, afraid, lonely, bored, and even tell jokes.\\n\\nAfter watching hours and hours of this talking animal content, it suddenly felt extremely inhumane to deny &lt;PERSON&gt; of the things I knew he was asking for, just on his body language alone. It also made me wonder about all the things he wants but isn't getting because I don't understand what he is trying to say.\\n\\nBased on this new knowledge, I decided to think of his wants and needs just as if he were a person, and it would be wrong of me to deny him of things because 1) I am kind of his parent and 2) it is very anthropocentric or \"people-centered\" to think that my needs and wants are more important than his.\\n\\nThe biggest and most immediate change between us was allowing him in the bed. He became so much more comfortable with me and my wife being gone during the day because he apparently just wanted to snuggle with us all night and recharge his cuddle battery. He quickly stopped doing naughty things like going through the trash and tearing up paper, things I now know he did to express that he was upset.\\n\\nSo if you have a pet who gets into mischievious things or has some other behavioral problem that you just can't seem to solve, try thinking about their feelings as just another being with feelings as opposed to as their pet parent. You will be surprised at how simple some of these issues are to solve by just giving them your undivided attention for 10 minutes a day, for example.</td>\n",

It works best when following the story of a kid putting on a brave face while reckoning with the fact that he may just be the messiah (which is interesting since BLADE RUNNER 2049 did the opposite, following someone coming to grips with the fact that they're not the chosen one after all), but a good few stretches of this wind up feeling like someone reading you the LOTR Appendices instead of the actual story itself -- mythology for the sake of mythology. Still, you have to give the suits at WB credit for not getting weak at the knees over all the gobbledygook crammed into these 2+ hours. For as vocal as &lt;PERSON&gt; was this time last year about their sudden theatrical/streaming hybrid release announcement (which he was totally justified in complaining about), at least they didn't pull the same kind of crap that &lt;PERSON&gt; did with &lt;PERSON&gt; and just slice his movie to incomprehensible bits - so, credit where credit is due, I guess.\\n\\nStill, it's hard to fully get a feeling for this Part One alone without the context of where things will go in the second film. By itself, this one feels mostly like a giant prologue, setting up a long string of plot devices that'll get paid off later on down the road which, I dunno, I guess is fine considering that that's the direction a lot of big genre content is going in these days - preferring serialized films that are so tightly connected to their follow-ups that they hardly have a leg of their own to really stand on, as opposed to something like, say FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING which managed to lay huge groundwork, establish its relationships, move its chess pieces, and raise the stakes all with its own individual emotional payoff and a sense of roundedness, i.e. it worked as both a standalone film and as a part of a trilogy. My feeling could change but right now DUNE - PART ONE feels exactly like its final line of dialogue -- \"This is just the beginning...\"\\n\\nThose sandworms though. &lt;PERSON&gt; kills at doing massive scale.</td>\n",

They delivered stellar performances and easily elevated the effectiveness of this film. They had so much chemistry as mother and son. As another note, that scene with &lt;PERSON&gt; rolling out of the truck almost made me pass out. It was mostly due to the fact that I honestly cared about the fate of the main characters, and that was easily the most suspenseful scene of the film (was so well done too).\\n\\nThe one thing I think I can judge this film on plot wise is that I would've liked to have seen more content from the real world, as well as more on how &lt;PERSON&gt; got into 'Room'.\\n\\nIs Room going to win Best Picture?

I don’t think I could explain the plot of this to you if my life depended on it. Something about terrorism and honor and ninjas and dick measuring.

He’s like if &lt;PERSON&gt; in &lt;PERSON&gt;’s Dune had a 78 IQ.\\n\\nThere’s actually some decent action in this, with the highlight being the big showdown between &lt;PERSON&gt; and the red-hooded henchman from the killer poster art. I mean, they’re not doing any super impressive choreography or anything, but the fight feels raw and intense and the camera never cuts or shakes around.

We meet a troubled security guard named &lt;PERSON&gt; (&lt;PERSON&gt;), who begins working at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. &lt;PERSON&gt; is the sole guardian of his little sister &lt;PERSON&gt; (&lt;PERSON&gt;) after the loss of their mother.

It’s pretty straightforward at the beginning until the dream sequences with &lt;PERSON&gt;. His dreams are meant to tell him about the man who had kidnapped his younger brother all those years ago, but all it does is connect him to other children, the ghost children in the animatronic puppets at &lt;PERSON&gt; Pizzeria.\\n\\nOn paper, this sounds interesting, and it had the potential to be a wicked supernatural horror film, but it falls short. The focus on &lt;PERSON&gt; and the actual children took away from the menacing animatronic puppets that do all the killing. Instead of working in the lore from the games, the actual gameplay should have been integrated. It became dream sequences upon dream sequences and only one sequence of the animatronic puppets coming out for the scares. The editing also ruined the tension because once the animatronic puppets were out of the frame and walking through the halls, it would cut to the recurring dream. Understandably, they wanted to make this family-friendly, but the 14A rating did not allow these filmmakers the creative freedom to integrate more kills.\\n\\nclick here for my full review</td>\n",

They did bloodwork and did not find anything wrong with his blood/heart. A neurologist diagnosed him with epilepsy. He started taking the meds 3 weeks ago. He got better the first day but then started getting worst each passing day. When he tries to walk he just falls over all the time. Some days he is just catatonic, doesn’t move any body parts except for his ears. He pees all over the place. His seizures are like this: he falls over and his body gets super stiff, he lifts all his limbs upwards.\\n\\nI’ve never seen epilepsy seizures like his online, so I’m not even sure lf the diagnosis was correct.\\n\\nHe was 5 kg 3 months ago, now he is barely 2 kilograms.\\n\\nHave you experienced anything similar, or have any advice on what to do?</td>\n",

       "      <td>Work place harassment\\n\\nI work at a hotel that's connected to an exclusive sports club. We have a mixture of hotel guests and locals with monthly memberships using both the hotel and the fitness facility. I've been at this current position for about 11 months and have I got the the crazy stories for you!\\n\\nOne of the stories that is still ongoing is an older club member is always standing by my desk asking me personal questions. I'm friendly for the most part but I don't want you being inappropriate with me. He started one conversation with, \"You get really good discounts, maybe we could share a hotel room.\" Right there I started feeling uncomfortable so I responded with, \"That's not appropriate to ask me in my place of work.\" He apologized and left. He had a couple more run in's with me like that until he invited me to his place. I reported him to the directors of the fitness side because that's a whole different department.\\n\\nOnce I reported him to the directors, he didn't even look at me while passing by! That stopped for a few weeks and then it started up again a few weeks ago. The first thing he did was come up to my desk and tell me how lonely he is. I told him to come to the club and relax with the other club members. He wanted to be my friend and get my number. That too was very inappropriate but I declined. I recently started seeing someone so that would help me. Our old man asked if I was seeing anyone and I said yes! Mr. thinks he's smooth said, \"Oh he's far too old for you, you should give me a chance!\" I looked at him because the guy I'm currently seeing is only three years older than me, not 62 years older than me. I shook my head no and told him that I was happy.\\n\\nThe last time he came in was Friday night. He asked how my little affair was going and I told him it was more than a little affair and I was happy. He then asked more personal questions about the things I do with my new boyfriend. That not right and thankfully one of the club side managers overheard him and told him he is going to report him for sexual harassment. I thanked him but this has been an ongoing problem. He's in the process of losing his membership.</td>\n",

I can’t not love the visuals.\\n\\nObviously, as a Fil-Am film-maker, I’m gonna be biased but maybe it’s because it feels like home. It feels like I’m back visiting my lola. It feels like when my parents would gush over their precious sari-sari stores.\\n\\nA few days ago, my mom ran up to me excitedly and told me this won the Special Jury Prize for Innovative Spirit at Sundance and that she was listening to the NPR segment with &lt;PERSON&gt;.

       "      <td>Well &lt;PERSON&gt;, what could go wrong c:\\n\\nNot a story about myself, but a buddy of mine!\\nDisclaimer I am not a native English speaker so... c:\\nOur bosses decided to open a new branch in Switzerland, and a buddy of mine got selected to set up the hardware. Timeframe was a complete horror. You may ask yourself why?\\nHe had two weeks to get a working concept with ordering the hardware, prep it and test\\n\\nAfter the hardware was delivered, he went to work, doing a 55-Hour week to set up and test his concept. All went well, and he was sent to the new branch office.\\n\\nIn Switzerland, he went straight to work. He plugged in the NAS and the PSU went POOOFFF. Keep in mind that the NAS is our backbone which hosts a site-to-site VPN, a network drive to share stuff and is our switch between two different internet connections.\\n\\nAfter that, he called us and let us know that he needs more time to organize a new PSU/NAS and an electrician needs to look at the situation. The guy who was called measured the voltage of the outlet. The guy told him, \"Well 411 Volts, I would guess the NAS is doomed.\"\\n\\nAfter that problem with the outlet got sorted and a new PSU was bought. All went well and I am still surprised that the NAS took the hit like a champ. Still working fine after two years.\\n\\nTLDR of the story: Even the best prep can go to waste in seconds</td>\n",

       "      <td>Should I tell my manager that she isn’t funny?\\n\\nMy manager (33F) has made several mean comments to me (27f) in front of my other coworkers. I am a very joking person so I don’t take playful comments too seriously but she has made comments that were actually mean, and I wanted to keep track in case we ever asked to review her as a manager. I work at a bank: 1. I have asthma and one day I knew an attack was coming on, so I needed to leave. It was 5:27pm and I was scheduled until 5:30PM. I asked to leave she said “You’re making a habit of this”. Mind you I have only missed work once, because I fainted doing hot yoga. I made it known I had asthma from the beginning. Now even when I am having asthma I don’t mention it to anyone.\\n\\n1. All of my coworkers were going out to lunch with for her and another coworkers birthday. She was asking what the best day for everyone (context: I have no family here, and I’m basically alone) Everyone else has families or are married. I was excited and told her I wouldn’t be busy at all so whatever day was decided was good for me, she responded “We weren’t asking you, I didn’t think you would be busy” and laughed.\\n\\n2. Yesterday, we were preparing for for our district manager to visit and I happen to be off the day of. While everyone was debating calling out and nervous, I said “Well, I’m glad to be off” and she said “I’m glad you are too, cause we need our strongest tellers only” I absolutely resented this cause I am in fact the strongest teller. I’m leading in NBS… I also have 100 percent for surveys and customers are constantly raving about my service. One time her own boss told her that if she wanted to suggest me for another position, he would co-sign.\\n\\nI don’t know if because I am a jokester, maybe she thinks these comments are also jokes. I am very respectful of her and honestly all my coworkers joke with each other but not like this at all. We are all passed “professional” jokes as coworkers. We can kind of get away with some off-color jokes like for example our service manager got a BBL so one of my coworkers joked that when we get coins from the vault we can just stack them on her ass.\\n\\nI am a lesbian and we were having an outing, someone suggested we all bring our partners and one of my coworkers said that he wasn’t bringing his wife because I might steal here, I said no we can share and since then he’s been my sister husband.\\n\\nAnyways nothing really malicious, maybe I am being too sensitive? Do you think I should discuss this with her? I don’t want her to feel uncomfortable to joke with me after this. I just don’t want her to be cruel.</td>\n",

I enjoyed 3 Billboards immensely, but was a bit underwhelmed for In Bruges, still enjoying it for the most part. I have to say I was pleasantly blown away with how much I got out of this.\\n\\nI would go as far to say I got more out of this than any other of his films, and is easily one of the best films of the year. At no point was I bored or felt disengaged. The psuedo-spiritual aspect of this in particular was the most fascinating, and all the performances, shots, and pacing was quite fantastic. The comedy itself may be too dark for some was hysterical for me and built up in an amazing blend of shock and hilarity.\\n\\nQuite a few times, I found myself getting lost in the dialogue at how it applied to my own life, feeling things similar to the characters, different applications of their mentalities, and reflecting on how I've spent my time and priorities. Anytime a film can do this for me or aid me in this I fall in love with it, and this puts it far and beyond a large portion of modern cinema. If I had to equate this film to a particular feel I would say this runs in the same vein as a lot of <PERSON> films.

The voiceover, particularly in the first act, reeked of simply not trusting the audience; A version of this opening playing with no dialogue would have been a stone-cold classic. <PERSON> is pretty good here, and when she shows up, the scene with <PERSON> is fantastic.\\n\\nI think people are overstating the politics a bit, or, rather, the politics are definitely there, but it is also basically just a rehashing of the politics of the <PERSON> franchise. It uses the killer-for-hire setting to comment on how an elite have increasingly insulated themselves from average citizens, and how they expect to play by different rules than those beneath them, freely changing the rules and agreements to suit their own agendas.\\n\\nStill, it is enough fun (and funny; the killer is pretty bad at his job sometimes!) that I think this would have been a four for me until the ending. But why he let the billionaire live after killing people much, much less culpable was frankly baffling to me. Thematically, I guess you could say that is a comment on who is above consequences too, but again <PERSON> is better at this. Here there's no real reason why he can't just kill the client, so for me it breaks the plot. Some lipservice is paid that the cops would investigate it more seriously since he was rich, but honestly the target at the beginning seemed pretty well off too; and are we to believe he never killed any wealthy or high-profile people? Why wasn't it a concern previously?\\n\\nIt left me with a bad taste in my mouth, which is probably the point, but I think <PERSON> got lazy in doing the heavy lifting that would have made the thematic point he wanted to make make narrative sense.   \n",

You're hired in, pay is decent, working remote - in my case, \"you'll be taking about 14-20ish calls a day, waiting around watching Netflix\" this is the life of a claims adjuster.\\n\\nWell, needless to say : Not the case.\\n\\nFast forward two years.\\n\\nI'm now a team lead for customer service, with the ability to jump in and handle claims. If it's not one thing it's another, but I do enjoy my job. I get to fix people's screw ups and help assist contract holders, and answer questions and whatnot. Aside for the job having it's pros and cons, it appears the \"higher ups\" always have their priorities in line.\\n\\nAvailability time.\\n\\nMy job requires me to remain available to perform it, and unfortunately..if I were to remain available, I'd be non-stop taking claims calls, then being asked questions between calls from customer service..taking \"supervisor\" calls (don't even get me started), all at once. Overall, too much.\\n\\nOne of my coworkers was on the chopping block because of high \"unavailable\" times, and it was made known he needed to fix it. Unfortunately he decided to leave because he felt like he couldn't do his job and got sick of the email threats from our manager.\\n\\nWell, less than a week later: I got that email. 80% unavailable time. Keep in mind, I am working. Fixing other people's claims and getting them authorized, addressing dissatisfied customers concerns and either putting a stop to them or assisting as much as possible. I am, in theory..a supervisor, but paid significantly less, as my title is a \"hybrid\" - team lead for customer service and a claims adjuster.\\n\\nAppears to me that all companies that follow metrics almost militantly, are either upset you're too available, too unavailable, etc.\\n\\nI'll be honest, I'm a foot out the door. I already know what's coming and I made it apparent to my manager that this whole issue goes against me taking the team lead position.\\n\\nI basically was met with \"my hands are tied, not my problem, adhere to it or you'll get warnings\" etc.\\n\\nAnyone else experiencing this?   \n",

It's great to see <PERSON>, Action Hero. There's a moment in the opening, with <PERSON> as a POW in Vietnam, where he is trying to avoid a guy trying to stab him, and so help me he does a little soft shoe shuffle out of the way. It's a split second but it's not far off from his work in the \"Weapon of Choice\" video.\\n\\nLoved it. <PERSON>' magnum opus. Nine stars on a scale of seven thumbs up!   \n",

He was also adopted from my mother-in-law, whose ex-fiancee fed him whatever human food he was eating himself at the moment. Because of these two things, <PERSON> is a very needy and vocal dog, and it can be frustrating to navigate his wants and desires as they often feel like an inconvenience.\\n\\nI felt this way about <PERSON> for our first two years together; however, I had a huge epiphany when I came across animals who use assistive communication devices such as Ellie the Cockatoo and <PERSON>.\\n\\nThe Revelation: The animals who are trained to communicate using iPads and buttons with speakers have fundamentally changed the way I understand animals' consciousness. They are able to express when they are sad, mad, afraid, lonely, bored, and even tell jokes.\\n\\nAfter watching hours and hours of this talking animal content, it suddenly felt extremely inhumane to deny <PERSON> of the things I knew he was asking for, just on his body language alone. It also made me wonder about all the things he wants but isn't getting because I don't understand what he is trying to say.\\n\\nBased on this new knowledge, I decided to think of his wants and needs just as if he were a person, and it would be wrong of me to deny him of things because 1) I am kind of his parent and 2) it is very anthropocentric or \"people-centered\" to think that my needs and wants are more important than his.\\n\\nThe biggest and most immediate change between us was allowing him in the bed. He became so much more comfortable with me and my wife being gone during the day because he apparently just wanted to snuggle with us all night and recharge his cuddle battery. He quickly stopped doing naughty things like going through the trash and tearing up paper, things I now know he did to express that he was upset.\\n\\nSo if you have a pet who gets into mischievious things or has some other behavioral problem that you just can't seem to solve, try thinking about their feelings as just another being with feelings as opposed to as their pet parent. You will be surprised at how simple some of these issues are to solve by just giving them your undivided attention for 10 minutes a day, for example.   \n",

And I gotta say, a lot of the jokes landed.\\n\\nBest for me was the utter lack of an attempt at a \"swing to the serious in the final act\" blunder made by something like 90% of comedies. Nope! If anything, they it just got funnier and more irreverent. It just kept going after the genre--and, perhaps, the subject matter--with its eyes always on the laughs.\\n\\nHulu informed me that this was from the makers of The Naked Gun, and I was a little doubtful. By the end, the fingerprints were unmistakable, especially when it descends into utter mayhem in the final act. This doesn't have the tears of mirth and guffaws I got from those classics, but the laughter was there, and consistently.\\n\\nIf you LOVE those classics... you'll probably like this.   \n",
       "7   <PERSON>\\n\\nVisually speaking, this is as gargantuan as anything that <PERSON> made in his late career, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA and RYAN'S DAUGHTER in particular, and it's as beautifully realized and rendered as you could ask for, combining <PERSON>'s grandeur with the lived-in grit and grim <PERSON> brought to STAR WARS and <PERSON> to SOLARIS.\\n\\nIt's as portentous and weighty as you could imagine (and then some), and so utterly steeped in mythology in a way that's simultaneously riveting and frustrating. I haven't read <PERSON>'s novel so I could be off-base with this, but I have a hard time believing that this is all that watered-down in the sheer intricate structuring of the world when compared to the novel. It works best when following the story of a kid putting on a brave face while reckoning with the fact that he may just be the messiah (which is interesting since BLADE RUNNER 2049 did the opposite, following someone coming to grips with the fact that they're not the chosen one after all), but a good few stretches of this wind up feeling like someone reading you the LOTR Appendices instead of the actual story itself -- mythology for the sake of mythology. Still, you have to give the suits at WB credit for not getting weak at the knees over all the gobbledygook crammed into these 2+ hours. For as vocal as <PERSON> was this time last year about their sudden theatrical/streaming hybrid release announcement (which he was totally justified in complaining about), at least they didn't pull the same kind of crap that <PERSON> did with <PERSON> and just slice his movie to incomprehensible bits - so, credit where credit is due, I guess.\\n\\nStill, it's hard to fully get a feeling for this Part One alone without the context of where things will go in the second film. By itself, this one feels mostly like a giant prologue, setting up a long string of plot devices that'll get paid off later on down the road which, I dunno, I guess is fine considering that that's the direction a lot of big genre content is going in these days - preferring serialized films that are so tightly connected to their follow-ups that they hardly have a leg of their own to really stand on, as opposed to something like, say FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING which managed to lay huge groundwork, establish its relationships, move its chess pieces, and raise the stakes all with its own individual emotional payoff and a sense of roundedness, i.e. it worked as both a standalone film and as a part of a trilogy. My feeling could change but right now DUNE - PART ONE feels exactly like its final line of dialogue -- \"This is just the beginning...\"\\n\\nThose sandworms though. <PERSON> kills at doing massive scale.   \n",

I’ve seen a couple of <PERSON> films, and I really like how he’s unafraid of bordering on cheesiness with his sentimentality but just keeps so much gravitas within his engaging characters that it doesn’t go too far. The obvious <PERSON> comparisons are apt (from a visual standpoint) but he reminds me wayyy more of <PERSON>-eda. Some serious Our Little Sister type stuff.\\n\\nAll of the performances are fantastic. <PERSON>, <PERSON> and little <PERSON>…Christ, all such naturalistic depictions of grief and <PERSON> just gives them and their characters so much time to breathe. It’s so hard not to fall in love with them. Just pure empathy all around, today’s cinema needs more of it!   \n",

He is the reflection a lot of characters here. Brilliant!\\n\\n<PERSON> and <PERSON>'s scene strike me as very memorable. Great details!\\n\\n\"Do you even know if the person in front of you is the real one you want to meet?\"\\n\\nThat's chicken and egg problem tho. How do we judge a person without records?

Only to go back to the start in the last two minutes. I am generally not a fan of that in movies, except if it's the other way around, but that might be just me.\\n\\nAltogether, it's an alright movie, great cast, interestingly directed, good story, fantastic soundtrack. Do with that what you will, but <PERSON> served cunt and is canonically bisexual here, so that's good enough for me.   \n",

Compelling script, precise direction and ensemble of all great actors.\\n\\nEveryone's so good here. <PERSON> just talked about loss of a child and I cried 😭 She's that good. <PERSON> as the pseudo title double role is loveeeeee. <PERSON> is exactly like the poster!!! He is the reflection a lot of characters here. Brilliant!\\n\\n<PERSON> and <PERSON>'s scene strike me as very memorable. Great details!\\n\\n\"Do you even know if the person in front of you is the real one you want to meet?\"\\n\\nThat's chicken and egg problem tho. How do we judge a person without records?

       "16                                              DNRs\\n\\nSeriously what is the fucking point of DNRing someone if the other people keep letting them come back. As well as the owner and gm???????\\n\\nFor instance one guy stayed a few months back had gotten into it with the owner and has an aggressive pitbull (no not all pitties are aggressive but this one is)\\n\\nThe owner told me to add him to the long list of dnr. Because they smoked in the room has the aggressive dog and trashed the room.\\n\\nThe owner told him not to come back literally to his face.\\n\\nSo i come in after being off yesterday and lowandbehold he has come back. 🙃\\n\\nI say something to the owner but they act like they dont give two shits\\n\\nSo what was the whole big deal last time then?\\n\\nHe comes to the desk today wanting to basically to the standard room and upgrade cause hes a starrbellysneech memeber.\\n\\n(You dont get an upgrade on booked out nights and its only to the suite not studio if its avaliable)\\n\\nAnd of couse they gotta do this at 11 right at check out time. With a fuck ton of shit packed into their room on a (1 night stay)\\n\\nHousekeeping knocks like 4 times they keeps shewing them away so the owner tells the guy hey its 1130 yall need move to the new room.\\n\\nOf cousrse he starts to argue saying i didnt let him check back in Which is a lie.\\n\\nHis phone signal was shit so he had to go outside and book it cause he didnt want to pay the higher rate.\\n\\nFinally it came through and i check him in within like 2 min. So no dude it wasnt me. You knew what time it was your reservation due to your shitty ass broken phone was the one who was fucking it up not me.\\n\\nHe had the dog and it still caost him like 180 woth the pet fee. And i charged it out before he left my desk. He is one of those who will turn their card off. Im making sure we got the money.\\n\\nAnd i blocked out the last standard room on pourpose.\\n\\nAnyway i jsut had a conversation that with the owner as to why... he said cause its been slow and he needs the money. So he got rid of the list that he himself told me to make.\\n\\nWe have not been slow this week almost every night we have been booked out. So spare me the bull shit Nile.\\n\\nI just threw my hands up and said hey om just letting you know. Is what it is.\\n\\nYou wanna argue with the same dumb asses every time go ahead.\\n\\n( i am quiet quitting anyways)\\n\\nI cant take the back and fourth double standard anymore. I do my job and its never good enough.\\n\\nI do one tiny thing wrong and i get reprimanded for it the other 3 dumb shits that work the desk do major fuck up never get anything said to them.\\n\\nJust done trying.\\n\\nIdk anymore what does yalls hotels do with dnrs?   \n",

A poor man’s Dil Chahta Hai- which isn’t a bad thing. The lovelorn <PERSON> is shared between <PERSON> & <PERSON> and the fuckboi character appears an amalgam of <PERSON>’s demeanour and <PERSON> circumstances. But the banter isn’t as natural as it was in DCH.\\n\\nSocial media is used well as its own character but so many movies have successfully done this by now that it doesn’t feel like a big deal. Bit late to the party? The film is most excruciatingly funny during moments of second-hand embarrassment and cringe. You will laugh and wince equally. OAFF’s sophomore album is more inconsistent than his first but he remains one of the more exciting music directors to emerge recently.   \n",

It went undetected by many (including me) and suddenly appeared as a Best Picture nomination. I decided to watch it and am quite glad that I did so.\\n\\nFirst of all, the two leads absolutely carry this film. They delivered stellar performances and easily elevated the effectiveness of this film. They had so much chemistry as mother and son. As another note, that scene with <PERSON> rolling out of the truck almost made me pass out. It was mostly due to the fact that I honestly cared about the fate of the main characters, and that was easily the most suspenseful scene of the film (was so well done too).\\n\\nThe one thing I think I can judge this film on plot wise is that I would've liked to have seen more content from the real world, as well as more on how <PERSON> got into 'Room'.\\n\\nIs Room going to win Best Picture? Probably not. Is <PERSON> going to get Best Actress? She very well could. Whatever the true answers are to these questions, this film was very enjoyable and not an Oscar bait film by any means.   \n",

Don’t run it into the ground.”\\n\\nLost Highway meets Red Zone Cuba. Recursive nightmare logic and paranoiac fugue states. Politically inscrutable ninja cabals carrying out clandestine assassinations. Deep state double agents getting a handle on <PERSON>. <PERSON> letting slide a late career <PERSON>. A paycheck is a paycheck to this none-too-picky Master Ninja. I might have been hallucinating, but I’m pretty sure his earring got slightly bigger in each scene.\\n\\nThis is awful and I loved every minute of it. The middle hour is just people saying the names <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON> and <PERSON> over and over again, and never once was I able to glean the meaning of any of it. I don’t think I could explain the plot of this to you if my life depended on it. Something about terrorism and honor and ninjas and dick measuring. And there’s a ton of weird echoey <PERSON> Voiceover, which I can only intuit is meant to represent his character’s dim-witted inner monologue. He’s like if <PERSON> in <PERSON>’s Dune had a 78 IQ.\\n\\nThere’s actually some decent action in this, with the highlight being the big showdown between <PERSON> and the red-hooded henchman from the killer poster art. I mean, they’re not doing any super impressive choreography or anything, but the fight feels raw and intense and the camera never cuts or shakes around. Sure, it ain’t <PERSON>, but at least it seems like an altercation transpiring between flesh-and-blood human beings on planet earth. Sometimes we forget what that looks and feels like.\\n\\nI caught bits and pieces of this on UHF television when I was maybe 8 or 9 years old in ‘85 or ‘86. It’s fucking hilarious to think of my youngest kids watching The Octagon. Their pop culture upbringing now is as vastly different to what I experienced growing up in the 80’s as mine was to that of the fucking pilgrims. Trying to imagine my angelic daughter sitting through Dirty Harry with commercial breaks on network television at 1PM on a Sunday like I did countless times when I was her age. Fascistic cops ignoring Miranda rights or Mr <PERSON> digging wells and doing cursed speed runs. Kids gotta watch something.\\n\\nLastly, you simply have to respect a movie where the credits roll within .83 seconds of the hero killing the bad guy.   \n",

We meet a troubled security guard named <PERSON> (<PERSON>), who begins working at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. <PERSON> is the sole guardian of his little sister <PERSON> (<PERSON>) after the loss of their mother. He has been trying to find a steady job and provide for her, but it has been hard for him. Amid a custody battle with his aunt, who thinks it’s safer for <PERSON> to go live with her, he finds a job thanks to <PERSON> (<PERSON>). <PERSON> describes the security job, and <PERSON> takes it. It’s pretty straightforward at the beginning until the dream sequences with <PERSON>. His dreams are meant to tell him about the man who had kidnapped his younger brother all those years ago, but all it does is connect him to other children, the ghost children in the animatronic puppets at <PERSON> Pizzeria.\\n\\nOn paper, this sounds interesting, and it had the potential to be a wicked supernatural horror film, but it falls short. The focus on <PERSON> and the actual children took away from the menacing animatronic puppets that do all the killing. Instead of working in the lore from the games, the actual gameplay should have been integrated. It became dream sequences upon dream sequences and only one sequence of the animatronic puppets coming out for the scares. The editing also ruined the tension because once the animatronic puppets were out of the frame and walking through the halls, it would cut to the recurring dream. Understandably, they wanted to make this family-friendly, but the 14A rating did not allow these filmmakers the creative freedom to integrate more kills.\\n\\nclick here for my full review   \n",

Its certainly not as refined as his masterworks, but still full of so much rich storytelling\\n\\n<PERSON> and <PERSON> are the perfect duo, and <PERSON> is clearly having so much fun playing <PERSON>, the perfect mix between his rigid stoicism and feral antics of other roles\\n\\nAs much as I love <PERSON>'s portrayal and the mark he left on the character for <PERSON> to elevate tenfold, this film always makes me so curious as to what <PERSON>'s Obi-Wan would have been like. Would have changed the entire trajectory of Star Wars from the beginning, had he said yes   \n",

He is a 5 year old british shorthair. They did bloodwork and did not find anything wrong with his blood/heart. A neurologist diagnosed him with epilepsy. He started taking the meds 3 weeks ago. He got better the first day but then started getting worst each passing day. When he tries to walk he just falls over all the time. Some days he is just catatonic, doesn’t move any body parts except for his ears. He pees all over the place. His seizures are like this: he falls over and his body gets super stiff, he lifts all his limbs upwards.\\n\\nI’ve never seen epilepsy seizures like his online, so I’m not even sure lf the diagnosis was correct.\\n\\nHe was 5 kg 3 months ago, now he is barely 2 kilograms.\\n\\nHave you experienced anything similar, or have any advice on what to do?   \n",

We have a mixture of hotel guests and locals with monthly memberships using both the hotel and the fitness facility. I've been at this current position for about 11 months and have I got the the crazy stories for you!\\n\\nOne of the stories that is still ongoing is an older club member is always standing by my desk asking me personal questions. I'm friendly for the most part but I don't want you being inappropriate with me. He started one conversation with, \"You get really good discounts, maybe we could share a hotel room.\" Right there I started feeling uncomfortable so I responded with, \"That's not appropriate to ask me in my place of work.\" He apologized and left. He had a couple more run in's with me like that until he invited me to his place. I reported him to the directors of the fitness side because that's a whole different department.\\n\\nOnce I reported him to the directors, he didn't even look at me while passing by! That stopped for a few weeks and then it started up again a few weeks ago. The first thing he did was come up to my desk and tell me how lonely he is. I told him to come to the club and relax with the other club members. He wanted to be my friend and get my number. That too was very inappropriate but I declined. I recently started seeing someone so that would help me. Our old man asked if I was seeing anyone and I said yes! Mr. thinks he's smooth said, \"Oh he's far too old for you, you should give me a chance!\" I looked at him because the guy I'm currently seeing is only three years older than me, not 62 years older than me. I shook my head no and told him that I was happy.\\n\\nThe last time he came in was Friday night. He asked how my little affair was going and I told him it was more than a little affair and I was happy. He then asked more personal questions about the things I do with my new boyfriend. That not right and thankfully one of the club side managers overheard him and told him he is going to report him for sexual harassment. I thanked him but this has been an ongoing problem. He's in the process of losing his membership.   \n",

Watching this felt like two halves of myself were being united — only ever divided by time and age.\\n\\nGoing into this film blind is a must so I don’t wanna give away too much but it’s the perfect blend of the love of making movies, the tenderness of connecting with family through art, and the elevated reworking of a genre so popular in Filipino cinema.\\n\\nAnd the visuals. I can’t not love the visuals.\\n\\nObviously, as a Fil-Am film-maker, I’m gonna be biased but maybe it’s because it feels like home. It feels like I’m back visiting my lola. It feels like when my parents would gush over their precious sari-sari stores.\\n\\nA few days ago, my mom ran up to me excitedly and told me this won the Special Jury Prize for Innovative Spirit at Sundance and that she was listening to the NPR segment with <PERSON>. It’s also the first Filipino film to compete since 2006 with The Blossoming of Maximo Oliveros. I’m sure that majoring in film at a mainly-white institution is a brown mother’s worst nightmare but as the NPR interview segment faded out, I saw hope in her eyes.\\n\\nAlso, anyone who knows me will understand why the last 15ish minutes made me cry but with love.\\n\\n(and thank you to my mother for helping me transcribe the first quote; i understand kapampangan better and it’s been a while since i picked up tagalog from teleseryes)   \n",

I was thrown to the wolves and given very little training. I quickly became lead server, train all the new servers, and handled all the events and VIP’s.\\n\\nI’m not saying all that to show off how good I am, but rather to show the staff was so bad I was good comparatively, and I never received proper training.\\n\\nI got hired at a job last week in an upscale, nearly fine dining place, (doesn’t have a somm on staff) my little sister lead serves at. She got the job with 6 years experience serving. They usually require years of experience, but they are aware of my less than three months of experience and decided to hire me despite it.\\n\\nI have my first shift tomorrow, and going over the food and drink menu is giving me huge imposter syndrome. I’ve never received a job through nepotism before. There are words for food I’ve never even seen or know how to pronounce. I’ve never been so unprepared for a job. I’ve never even eaten at a fine dining establishment.\\n\\nThe more I learn, the more I learn I don’t know. There is no way I’m going to be able to memorize everything on the menu’s by my first shift tomorrow which was my goal. I still have no idea about any of the etiquette such as language, place settings, wine pairings, etc. Any help or tips would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading this far!   \n",

Nor does the word “complicated” seem sufficient. Of course the tortured genius, Promethean mythology is in the foreground and is clearly in many ways a proxy for himself (albeit only operating on a single level of self awareness) but <PERSON> makes no attempt to conceal the horror not just of the event but of the idea that a moral objective cannot compete against ego. But punishment is not absolution, in the eyes of the public or within. To me the final 40 minutes feels like a reprise of <PERSON>’s comment to him in the woods: when reckless self interest leads to destruction, do not expect they will indulge you your guilt.   \n",

I walk over there and show him the items and recommend which one he should get, because I have a lot of knowledge on the items. He asks some questions, dumb ones, and pauses for a minute between each, but nothing out of the ordinary. I say yes sir to a question he repeated and begin to walk away.\\n\\nHe starts slowly trying to make up another question as i’m walking away. A stupid question with the most obvious answer printed on the front of the box. Then i start to walk away again.\\n\\nHe stops me again and says “so it will work then??” after i just said it will work at least 3 or 4 times by now.\\n\\nBruh what the actual fuck. It’s really getting to the point where it’s 2 out of 3 customers who are fucking rude as hell, absolute idiots who are dumber than bricks, or just completely helpless and think you’re their personal assistant there for there every need.\\n\\nLike people are so damn useless they can’t figure anything out for themselves. They need their hand held for everything. These customers suck.\\n\\nBut I swear it’s getting worse every week!!! Like I am LITERALLY MIND BLOWN by how stupid people are on an hourly basis. Some of these questions I genuinely can’t believe they are asking. Like no fucking way you’re that stupid!   \n",

Timeframe was a complete horror. You may ask yourself why?\\nHe had two weeks to get a working concept with ordering the hardware, prep it and test\\n\\nAfter the hardware was delivered, he went to work, doing a 55-Hour week to set up and test his concept. All went well, and he was sent to the new branch office.\\n\\nIn Switzerland, he went straight to work. He plugged in the NAS and the PSU went POOOFFF. Keep in mind that the NAS is our backbone which hosts a site-to-site VPN, a network drive to share stuff and is our switch between two different internet connections.\\n\\nAfter that, he called us and let us know that he needs more time to organize a new PSU/NAS and an electrician needs to look at the situation. The guy who was called measured the voltage of the outlet. The guy told him, \"Well 411 Volts, I would guess the NAS is doomed.\"\\n\\nAfter that problem with the outlet got sorted and a new PSU was bought. All went well and I am still surprised that the NAS took the hit like a champ. Still working fine after two years.\\n\\nTLDR of the story: Even the best prep can go to waste in seconds   \n",

I understood how much this sucked because I usually have Wednesday off for the mrs and Thursdays off for my boys high school football games. Varsity plays Fridays.

I am a very joking person so I don’t take playful comments too seriously but she has made comments that were actually mean, and I wanted to keep track in case we ever asked to review her as a manager. I work at a bank: 1. I have asthma and one day I knew an attack was coming on, so I needed to leave. It was 5:27pm and I was scheduled until 5:30PM. I asked to leave she said “You’re making a habit of this”. Mind you I have only missed work once, because I fainted doing hot yoga. I made it known I had asthma from the beginning. Now even when I am having asthma I don’t mention it to anyone.\\n\\n1. All of my coworkers were going out to lunch with for her and another coworkers birthday. She was asking what the best day for everyone (context: I have no family here, and I’m basically alone) Everyone else has families or are married. I was excited and told her I wouldn’t be busy at all so whatever day was decided was good for me, she responded “We weren’t asking you, I didn’t think you would be busy” and laughed.\\n\\n2. Yesterday, we were preparing for for our district manager to visit and I happen to be off the day of. While everyone was debating calling out and nervous, I said “Well, I’m glad to be off” and she said “I’m glad you are too, cause we need our strongest tellers only” I absolutely resented this cause I am in fact the strongest teller. I’m leading in NBS… I also have 100 percent for surveys and customers are constantly raving about my service. One time her own boss told her that if she wanted to suggest me for another position, he would co-sign.\\n\\nI don’t know if because I am a jokester, maybe she thinks these comments are also jokes. I am very respectful of her and honestly all my coworkers joke with each other but not like this at all. We are all passed “professional” jokes as coworkers. We can kind of get away with some off-color jokes like for example our service manager got a BBL so one of my coworkers joked that when we get coins from the vault we can just stack them on her ass.\\n\\nI am a lesbian and we were having an outing, someone suggested we all bring our partners and one of my coworkers said that he wasn’t bringing his wife because I might steal here, I said no we can share and since then he’s been my sister husband.\\n\\nAnyways nothing really malicious, maybe I am being too sensitive? Do you think I should discuss this with her? I don’t want her to feel uncomfortable to joke with me after this. I just don’t want her to be cruel.   \n",

It’s long and grim but so rewatchable to me. <PERSON> gives an amazing performance as the compulsive serial killer, void of empathy. It’s told so well like a book because the audience gets to learn so much about the character and I love how it’s done in chapters and slightly out of order.\\n\\nIt’s comedic at times watching him stumble around a crime scene he needs to clean up, and when he gets annoyed with an incompetent clerk or an abrasive <PERSON>. It’s also terribly ruthless at times but it needs to be to tell the story. And with a satisfying conclusion, all of the pay-off is worth it. Morbid subject matter, maybe yes, but it’s art.   \n",

Everything here is building to that huge Helm’s Deep/March of the Ents/Battle of Osgiliath cross-cutting climax, and it delivers on all fronts, with several soul-stirring speeches and moving moments in between the awesome battle sequences. A beautiful achievement.\\n\\nAnd it’s of course telling that said stretch of the film is the one that is touched the least by this extended edition. I’m not gonna overly rag on it, but the problems remain: neutered pacing and double beats galore. Oh well!\\n\\nI started to doze off a few times here, which doesn’t bode well for the four and a half hour finale yet to come.   \n",

First thought was “eh it’s a Netflix original that came straight to streaming, how good could it be?” Which might be one reason why my rating is so high.\\n\\nI actually really enjoyed the fact that we’re in the dark for the entirety of the film. We know as much as the characters do and left to guess how this will turn out in the end. Also maybe the Friends references got a little annoying but I used to be a 13-year-old girl, and no one could’ve stopped her her on her mission.\\n\\nA few things were out of place and I wished I could’ve seen more of <PERSON>, but otherwise I enjoyed this a lot. The performances were great and the story was well done and fresh for a plot line that has been done so many times.\\n\\nA review that’s an actual review instead of a witty one sentence-er so you know I’m for real   \n",

I’ve seen a couple of <PERSON> films, and I really like how he’s unafraid of bordering on cheesiness with his sentimentality but just keeps so much gravitas within his engaging characters that it doesn’t go too far. The obvious <PERSON> comparisons are apt (from a visual standpoint) but he reminds me wayyy more of <PERSON>-eda. Some serious Our Little Sister type stuff.\\n\\nAll of the performances are fantastic. <PERSON>, <PERSON> and little <PERSON>…Christ, all such naturalistic depictions of grief and <PERSON> just gives them and their characters so much time to breathe. It’s so hard not to fall in love with them. Just pure empathy all around, today’s cinema needs more of it!   \n",

It never apologizes for its strange story directions, but it does still maintain a sense of sincerity.\\n\\nChapter 2 crosses that line a bit more, ramping up the ridiculousness (which I love), as well as some of the more pervasive silliness (which I don’t love as much). As much as I can suspend my disbelief and invest in the absurd time-traveling ghosts angle, it is harder to do so when the two ghost hunters are constantly joking around and making quips. Their presence in the first was relatively reserved, but here it’s a bit too much.\\n\\nThat said, I really do love how weird this story gets, and it still maintains that signature <PERSON> style.   \n",

Everyone was so desensitized to terror that horror movies needed to be next-level grisly to get people’s attention. The rise of torture porn is all over this movie, and that’s just the theatrical cut ( the director’s cut has a deeply unpleasant and very unnecessary rape scene. Do not watch it).   \n",

Gonna give it a week or two and maybe another viewing. It’s beautifully made and it really commits, as does everyone who appears in it. A lot less funny than In Bruges but a lot less clunky as a drama than Three Billboards, he did find a good balance this time.   \n",

She gives one of my favorite performances of 2022 and I really do hope she gets more roles that show off her acting abilities like this one! The cinematography gives off old movie vibes and I could not get enough of it! The huge ass monologue near the end of the movie blew me away because honestly I wasn’t expecting it to be in the movie! The movie genuinely scared me and made me uncomfortable on multiple occasions (mainly that scarecrow scene the less said the better) <PERSON> and <PERSON> did a amazing job of making us feel as isolated from the world as <PERSON>! So yeah I adored this movie! Go check it out and also go watch (X) you won’t regret it!   \n",

But on the other hand, I’ve also at times been like <PERSON> (selfish, neurotic), and met people like <PERSON> (fumbling, passionate). They’re very real characters, much moreso than in almost anything else <PERSON>’s ever made - it’s definitely his romcom. But — I like it less than I did. Maybe his schtick is more grating to me now than it was, or maybe I just found parts of it a little dull, but honestly I almost preferred Manhattan… Anyway, this is one of those movies where I can never seem to remember the ending even after seeing it 3 times. No clue if it’ll stick now, but at least I’ve seen it again.   \n",
