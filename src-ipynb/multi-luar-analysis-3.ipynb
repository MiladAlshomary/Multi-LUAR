They sent them to me very quickly and I am very satisfied with the product., The image was perfect, Arena di Verona was magnificient.  I was disappointed when I heard the singers.  Not good at all. There are subtitles, this was not the problem.  As we say in French, \"tant pis\".  Martin, Susana's husband., The sound is really awful.  I like the singers though.  The sound...it sounds as an old 78.  If you are deaf...buy this.  But put the subtitles!  Martin, I loved the singers, the mise en scene is weird though.  I would recommend this Carmen.  A beautiful version.  Martin, Susana's hubby., I didn't expect so beautiful versions.  I love these concertos and the pianos are vibrant.  Thank you very much for the good music.  Martin, Just the very best version I have.  I have 3 other versions, borenboim, mehta, furtwangler... I don't know about the other versions...but I love this one and I also have the libretto, the singers are the very best.  Martin, I bought this title because I liked the singers... Rodion Schedrin is not a very talented composer, he owns his fame to his wife, the great dancer, Maya Plisetskaya... He was very well positioned in the Communist party... But except his Carmen ballet from Bizet opera... You can't ask too much.  He is a mediocre composer.  And this is not an exception.  He is modern, but not too much, nothing teally new.  Of course, this is my humble opinion...\\n\\nMartin, Very good, but 4 CDs for just overtures, a little too much.  I bought his complete operas, then I had 3 CDs with syphonic music for the price of 7 CDs.  When I bought this I didn't know that.  After buying 13 operas, 5 weren't completed, I just lostened of three of them.  Of course, if you don't like opera, it is a deal.  But, in my humble opinion, if you don't like opera don't approach Siegfried, he is mainly an opera composer. Martin Pitchon, not Susana., Yes, this is an early work conversely her first book.  It's a romance and a mystery very well written.  I liked it very much and when I was in the last 3rd of the book it was really difficult to leave it.  I had to stay up till 4AM to finish it!\\nIf you are going on vacation or have some days off it will be the perfect time to read it!, I liked the story even if is not very original and a bit slow moving. Why? Because the interaction between the characters is true and interesting. It is a sweet story, not realistic but poignant nonetheless., A new writer for me, Ms arnold delivers a nice classic romance.  It doesn't have surprises in it's plot but the story reads smoothly and has a sweet love story in it.  Myabe is not accurate in terms of court strategy, as some of the reviewers say, but it was most agreable to read., I downloaded this book for free and I was glad for it to be so.\\nThe plot and the 5 stars reviews pushed me to downloaded and read it immediately even if I have 600+ books to read and I was hoping for more from this book.  It is not bad but it lacks something.\\nFirst, some parts drag for a long time and there is nothing coming out of it (and I should tell you that I like my books long, the longer the better when they have something interesting to tell) then the dialogues were a bit out there, seeming forced.\\nThe story is not bad, maybe with a good editor it could even be a very good book.  What I liked it was that the H/h didn't fall for each other the first minute they saw each other, it was a bit at a time and the portrayal of the Shetlands was very accurate and nice., I liked it but I think that a professional editor could have improved some parts of the book. The story line has some inconsistencies and some parts that are not explained but all in all it is a good story. It is a bit strange that the heroine can fall in love with this cruel man but it is a fantasy romance so... it could happen., I enjoyed the story very much. It makes a fun and easy reading when you have a short time to read but it is satisfying. A little treasure. I usually like my romances longer but this one doesn't disappoint., I don't even know where to begin.  The story wasn't awful but the usual romance.  h is in love since forever with the H and he was always trying to avoid her (they were children at the time) then she returns home and she is beautiful and accomplished and he is in lust with her but he doesn't want a serious relationship because of the dangers of his work.  But if it was told in an interesting form it could be good.  The situations are ridiculous and forced and the dialogues poor and so not interesting.  I finished it but it was really hard work. At least it was short., I've read these books a long time ago and I don't remember the details but they stayed with me all this time.  They are on my list of favourite books of all time.  What I remember is:  great adventure, lovable characters and strong plot.  It is definitely a must read., A great page-turner. If you have to take a long flight this would be the ideal book to take with you. It's the first book I've read of this author and I loved it. I will be reading more for sure. The situations were well created and evolved naturally in the environment of the plot. I recommend this book for the adventure loversand there is a bit of romance too., Jezebel's blues is a beautiful love story.  It has a tortured hero, a disillusioned heroine and a catastrophe that leaved them stranded and alone for two days.  The story is touching, sexy, romantic.  I will recommend this book to my friends., I bought this book because I love to read new spins on a fairy tale and the reviews of this book spoke of that.  The spin is new and original and I liked the characters.  They are interesting, well rounded and have the potential to be funny.  Most of the reviews say that the book is funny.  It is true that it has some funny scenes but for me the humour in these scenes seemed a bit forced.  There are some nice passionate scenes and all in all the book was nice to read and I would recommend it if you like fairy tales., This is a nice book to read and relax.  A story whith love, adventure and a bit of history.  It is not Gone with the Wind but it is a good story.  The characters are engaging and you will have a nice time with them.  If you like books with romance but with more substance then you will like this one.\\nThe story begins in England where Nicholas is betrayed by his stepmother out of his inheritance so he embarks to America to search for a new life and his fortune.  He will stay in the South in the years just before the Civil War.  There he will build a beautiful and grand plantation and meet Mandy.\\nYou have the H/h relationship since Mandy was a child, an engaging and willful child, and some interesting supporting characters that give the book his flavour., I am almost finished with book three of this series and I've already bought the next one, volume two which contains books four, five and six. I love the books and the characters are great.  They are so well constructed. Captain Lacey is an imperfect character that lends reality to the novel and the secondary characters are all very interesting too, like Grenville or the mysterious Mr. Denis. Love them all. Now I have less time to read but these books are really interesting and I bring them with me to work so I can read during my lunch time. So if you like mysteries do yourself a favor and begin reading the first book., As I said on the review of the other books of this series I loved these books, I had the first one for free and I couldn't stop there. If you are going away on vacation this is a perfect book to take on the beach., Liked this book a lot. It seemed liked a blend of Buffy the vampire slayer and the fever series. The characters are alive. Michel is the dark hero, we don't know if he is good or hides so ething very dark. There is adventure all along not a minute of respite. Now I bought the next book and I am going to read it just now. Can't wait!, I've read all of the series and loved it. The first book was a frebie by Amazon and after reading it I couldn't stop there. This author was new to me but now i am going to read all her books. Her charscters are lovable and real and I love what she have done with this other world., It is a nice story, a story of hope and the rhythm is also interesting.  I liked the characters also even if at times they sounded too perfect but as I said the story was nice and sweet.  But, and this is a big but, the narrator clubbed me with a big hammer on the head about alcoholism.  Yes, I know that alcoholism is a very big problem and yes I know that it can destroy a person, a family but I don't need to be hammered with it every two pages on the book.  I think, on the positive side, that this book could be rescued and be edited and be a very nice book to read., I had the first book of this series for free and I bought all the subsequent books because I was hooked on the storyline. The characters are engaging and true. It's been some time since I 've read this so I don't remember details but what I remember is that I liked it and that I am waiting for. Ore books on this series., I've read these books a long time ago when they first appeared on paper so i can't really review them because I don't remember the details but what I remember is that I loved them. They were the first I read of Ms. Canham and they hooked me. After that I bought every Marsha Canham's book., When I read this series some months ago I fell in love with the writing. I didn't know Ms. Thacker but now she is in my list of writers to follow. Her characters are real people with flaws and very endearing. When I read the first book I didn't know what to expect so it was a very nice surprise and I loved it. The first and third books have a touch of the fantastic. So if you like the fantastic, time travel and sweet romance, you will love these three books., Weak. Not great.  Dev is cool, but so many books so similar becomes a bit boring, I liked this book very much. I recommend it if you like heartwarming romances. It kept me entertained in a beautiful summer day. Read it!, I had this story as a freebie and thus I feel bad to give a bad review but I couldn't even finish it.  It was boring and I was always hoping that things would change and that the characters would begin acting like people and not like characters in a story.  Sorry but for me it wasn't worthy of my time.  I give it 2 stars because at least there wasn't grammar mistakes like in other freebies., It surprised me! I had this book for free and I wasn't sure what I was going to get. But it was a very nice reading., This is a nice reading, well written but do not think it is realistic. I liked it very much as an escapist reading. I had a very nice moment with this book. So if you like romance, I think you will like it. It has all the ingredients. Beautiful heroine, gorgeous and succesful heroe, problems falling all over them, the heroine has had a difficult time when she was a child. And what I liked the most, the hero is very sweet., Maybe that's the problem, that I haven't read the same book. I can't understand the 4 and 5 star reviews. First, why make it about angels when all the attitudes and the surroundings and the way of \"life\" was so earthly? In another environment this could have been more credible. The dialogues seem written by a high school student. Here is an example:\\n\"He's blocked you. I'll try\"\\nA moment later Nitro spoke again. \"He's blocked me too, and Celeste has tried too, it's a total block\"\\n\\nI don't want to be cruel but this story needs a lot of work before being ready for publishing., A fun book to read and the story of the angels is worked differently from the ones I've read till now. I loved to read the two stories developed here and I want to read the next book. Searching for it after writing this. I recommend this book, Usually I don't read billionaire romances because again, usually, I find them an easy way for authors to iron difficult situations with easy money. But here this novel? I absolutely loved it! I bought it only because it was a Miriam Minger without knowing that I was going to be fascinated by the book and the characters. Hannah and Cain are great characters that stay true to themselves throughout the book. It is a STEAMY romance and a delightful one! READ IT!, I didn't know the writer and the book was free so my expectations weren't great but what a wonderful surprise I had!  This is a romance but the heroine is not exactly like so many that you find in other books. She is fierce and sometimes acts impulsively but the difference here is that she thinks in a way way ahead of her time. Not to do stupid things but things that are really important to her as a person, to grow as a person. The storyline is great and I loved the way it is told. So I think it is a great book worth reading and keeping., There is someone here that says that SEP writes always the same storyline and she is right!  But I continue to buy them because she writes so well!  I love her writing even if the storyline is repeated but in this book the hero, Ted, is not very likeable and the chemistry between H/h is not working for me.  The sex is a bit off, is it me?\\nBut the book is very likeable, a very nice book to read on the beach (I am dreaming of beaches) or if you have a nice weekend to read., I almost didn't buy this book after all the bad reviews I read.  Someone said that we could skip this book and go right to the third one \"Bonnie\" but finally I decided to buy  it and make my own opinion about it and I am really happy that I did it.  I loved it.  Yes, maybe there isn't a lot of new things happening in the first half of the book but as I read the first books on this saga a long time ago it refreshed my memory about Joe's and Eve's relashionship and the last third of the book was really a roller coaster and the end a big cliffhanger.\\nYes, I know that Ms Johansen has been leading us with this story a long time but \"Eve\" and \"Quinn\" are very good stories preparing us, I hope, for the final end (excuse the redundance). So, if you liked the other books I can't see why you wouldn't like these.  I even liked them more than some of the precedent books in this saga., I feel mixed about this book.  On the one hand I liked it, the rhythm, the way it develops and evidently the characters.  I've been reading about Eve and Quinn since the beginning and as much as I liked them I wanted this to end.  As all the other readers of Ms Johansen I wanted to know what happened to Bonnie and for Eve to found her and bring her home but, and this is a personal but, I don't know if I liked the way the author found to resolve the mystery of Bonnie.\\nAlong the way we had so much angst that this felt like an anticlimax but on the other hand I felt relieved.  Maybe that is the way it should be.  I can relate to that.\\nSo if you are like me that followed all the series I imagine you want to read this book to know how it ends.  I think it's worth it and as I said on the reviews of the last two (Eve and Quinn) even if the book sometimes goes back it is nice to remember some things that we read a long time ago.\\nI am happy to know that it will be a book about Catherine which is a wonderful character and I would like to see some of the older supporting characters, like Logan., I loved this book.  It's beautifully written and the characters are well developped.  Nicole confronts her fears like any one of us would do and not like the heroine of a book, she goes step by step, fighting with her doubts till the last minute when she has no choice but to step on the plane.  And there she continues with the fighting, she will fight every day of her life.  And the end is open for speculation or maybe a saga.  It's not important, you can close it yourself.\\nRead it, it's worth it., I loved this book.  Be prepared at the end to cry, it is a very emotional and hot romance.  It's been a long time since I've read a book that I liked so much.  The characters are true to themselves.  What I don't understand are the bad reviews, this book is well written and the characters well developped.  It is worth every one of the five stars., I have read only two Andersen books and this one was really fun to read. This book has funny moments, sweet moments and hot moments. Macy is a loving and lovable character and the chemistry between her and Gabe is hot, as hot as the fires that Gabe puts out when he is working. It is true that this is a predictable romance but I think is is well written and worth to be read., The plot was very interesting and it was what kept me going when the descriptions of the feelings of the characters for each other were out there repeating themselves ad nauseum. This book could have been a lot shorter ( and believe me I love long books when they are good and they ade long for a reason) and IMO it would have been better. It wasn't bad but I've found myself skipping parts in the middle because of their \"longueur\"., I am a huge fan of Marsha Canham's books and there were only 3 that I hadn't read:  Chine Rose, Bound by the heart and The wind and the sea.  Now I am happy that she released them on Kindle giving me the opportunity to read them!  I've read Bound by the Heart and I fell in love with the book.  It's really a good book and I assure you you can't put it down.  The intrigue is well spinned and the characters well done.\\nAt the moment I am reading China Rose and loving it and waiting for The wind and the sea.\\nA must read book!, I've read 15 books in this series and all are very good. I love the characters, Roarke with the contrast of tough businessman and loving husband, Eve with the damaged soul and caring for the victims of violence, Summerset the mysterious butler and all the other secondary characters. In each book Eve's and Roarke's past and history is revealed a bit further and you have also the who dunnit mystery of each murder. Each book can be read separately but if you read the series in order is better because you gain to know each character more and more. And this book doesn't disappoint, I loved every one of the books I've read in this series. The more interesting thing in them are the characters, even if the plot is very good too. The best thing is to read them in order but you can read them individually too. But if you read them in order you will have a better hold on Eve's and Roarke's story. IMO they are great to take with you on holidays to the beach. I've have read at least 15 of them and they don't disappoint!, This is my first book by Ms Bretton and it was a very nice surprise.  I loved the story and the characters are engaging.  They are not perfect and this is what makes them so likable and they are not judgmental as in some books that when the h or H discovers the secret the other is keeping and they go nuts and almost destroy the relationship.  The development flows in a natural manner and the characters have natural dialogs even if this remains a romance and evidently there are some elements out of reality but they are credible in the romance world. It was a very emotional story, sweet, romantic and it felt like being enveloped by a cozy blanket.\\n I would like to know the story of some of the supporting characters like Hall. So I will be reading more books of this author., It took me sometime to get to this book once I downloaded it, maybe because the idea of reading about fires didn't appeal to me at the time but once I began reading I couldn't put it down. This is a great book with adventure, romance and a great insight in human psychology.  The caracters are endearing and really human not some paper invention., This is the first book I read by Ms. Alessandro and I absolutely loved it.  Now I am searching for the next book by her!, I began reading this book not knowing what to expect. Usually I don't read horror books but this one was a very good story. It kept me spell ound reading wanting to know how it would end. The plot was twisted, a good twiste, and the characters felt real. Loved it. The only thing was that the Kindle edition had some editing problems., The story was great. I loved it even if it kept me sleeping very badly because I was really immersed in it. Usually I don't read horror or supernatural stories but I am glad I did. The only bad thing was the formatting that made the reading difficult., Lovely story. It has it all, a fast paced plot, adventure, intrigue, humor, a wonderful hero and although the heroine was hideous to him it goes well in the story because is justified by her personal history.\\nIt is the second book I read by Miriam Minger and the first historical romance by her and I loved it as much as the other one (Ripped Appart). I had this book for free and I just bought the second book in THE MAN OF MY DREAMS SERIES, My Runaway Heart. Ms Minger you have a new fan of your books!, I love this series and this book was all I hoped for.  It has an interesting plot, adventure, suspense... it has you wondering, what's next? It was difficult to put it down and I enjoyed it very much BUT, and for me this is a big but, there are some grammar problems: We're/Were, you're/your, drug/drag and others.  These are only some examples.  The price of this book is not $0.99 and this author is not a beginner either so please, grammar IS important to give your book a good name. I say this because the book is really good and I think it is a pity to deface it with bad grammar when it is possible to correct this. I say this with all respect and I repeat, this is a very good story., Don't search for reality in this book.  I loved it as an escapist story and it made me sigh in pleasure.  This is a great book to read when you are on a vacation to escape reality and inmerse you in a great fantasy. It is a very sweet story, well written and it made me daydream. The characters,principal or secondary, are dears and engaging.  For me this author is new and now I am buying the next one in this series because I absolutely want to know Joe story. I highly recommend this book., I have read more than 30 books by Ms Deveraux and usually I like them very much.  Some of them I loved, others were very funny but this book was very disappointing.  The characters were very weak and I had the feeling that they were only a sketch and not totally finished.  They had only two dimensions and I couldn't be atracted or attached to them.  The plot could have been interesting if the characters could collaborate but they seemed not to be interested.  The dialogues were disjointed and empty. The problem with this book was not the intention to make a different romance without sex, I think sex in a romance book is great but not essencial for a great one., I liked this book.  It was a nice and sweet story with just the right amount of angst and emotion.  The characters were charming and engaging, the main and supporting ones.  The plot is interesting and it flows very well.\\nThe only thing is there were grammar and spelling mistakes, not so much to be distracting but some were hilarious, I think they were produced by autocorrect.  One of them, that came all the time was the word \"feet\" each time it was supposed to be \"fact\", another one \"fete\" instead of \"fate\".  This is only a minor thing.\\nAll in all is a very nice book., Well, I haven't yet finished the book but I have to agree with the ppl that say that this book is not good.  It's true that it's the first time that I read a romance that goes on the erotica genre.  I have read some classic erotica very explicit also but well written and I can't say the same thing about \"The Irish Devil\".  The plot begins in a very interesting way and the characters seem also interesting but after one or two chapters all is only an excuse for sex and not sex as a consequence of the storyline.\\nI will try to finish it because I hate to leave a book unread in the middle but  I don't think I am going to buy another book by this author., I've read this book some months ago and I don't remember all the details but some of the other people resumed it in detail.  What I remember and stayed with me was that it is a very well written story with true characters and a very interesting storyline.  It's a story about mothers and daughters, coming of age and human relationships.  Maybe you have to be a mother or a daughter or both to enjoy it and this is why some of the critics weren't good.  I don't know but I enjoyed it and I recommend it., I agree with one of the reviewers who says that it seems that two storylines put together to make a book.  But it is not a bad reading.  It could be better but it is entertaining.]</td>\n",
       "      <td>[I've had this book on my Kindle for a time now and finally I decided to read it.  I am happy that I did, it's a wonderful book.  Well written and a heartfull story.  One weekend to revisit the past, to put it really in the past and be able to look forward.  A father, a son and a grandfather that finally are able to really speak to each other with the truth., This book was a surprise, a good one.  It's a very pleasant read, the characters are lovable and I had a good time reading it. You will have a good time with it at the beach or in the winter near the hearth with a cup of tea.  It's a very positive book without being sanctimonious., This was the only book I hadn't read by Ms Canham and I was lucky that it was reissued on Kindle.  I loved it as all her other books before.  The characters are three dimensional, real people and not perfect at all.  The only thing to say about this book is that I would have liked the end to be less abrupt.  I think the characters needed more time to resolve their issues but other than that you will have the time of your life reading it.  It's a perfect book to read on an icy evening near the fire with a cup of tea or a glass of wine.  Have fun!, I loved all Amanda Stevens' books. This is no exception. It is a very good story, very well written. The characters are interesting and well developed BUT the ending of the book left me wanting more. It felt rushed, it left too many strings not attached. I don't want to bring spoilers here so lets only say that a few. Ore pages or an epilogue would have left me satisfied. As a reader, after reading all this book I needed closure, as well as the characters in the book, well I consider that I didn't have it. Nevertheless this is a book worth reading. I'm giving it 3 and a half stars., I couldn't finish this book.  Usually I like romances and I don't have a problem with Christian books when they don't hit you on the head with Jesus. This book was BORING, boring.  I can't understand all the 5 stars reviews.  At least it was free.  I don't like to write a bad review but I think I owe it to the next reader., Some of the reviewers disliked the H and the h. I think they didn't read the story the same way as others. The characters were true to their personalities and their background experiences. I liked the plot, the development and the characters.  I think the writer did a very good job on this story. I would recommend this book to my friends., Although this story is predictable it is not bad.  The ending is a bit abrupt and sometimes it feels like the characters aren't really in the story but it is a nice reading., I had this book for free and that is why I decided to try it because I didn't know the author. The idea is very nice and the plot is interesting but... and I think this is important, there are so many mistakes, typos, grammar, tense mistakes that the book losses credibility. Ms Connors should invest in an editor to help improve a book that have a big potential but losses it in the way. Maybe also polish some parts. It's really a pity to leave it like this., Michael Hicks strikes again!  Another interesting book.  When you read this you know that many of the things told in this story are true.  The GMO have been among us for some years now and the big corporations are the ones testing them and saying that they are safe and many of the executives of this corporations are now members of the government that aprove them.  The same can be said about pharmaceutical companies which are also connected to the ones fabricating the GMO seeds.  And the only thing that Mr Hicks took from fantasy is the alien conspiracy.  So yes, I think this is well thought and I liked a lot the way he tells this story.  And the characters are human and imperfect.  It's a nice book to take on vacation or at home for a rainy weekend or for reading on your patio under the sun.  But read it!, The final chapter of the IN HER NAME series is an amazing conclusion.  Sometimes during the reading I asked myself how the narrator could find a solution for the difficult knots in the plot but there was always a wonderful surprise ahead.  At times I was drying a tear here and there also.  This series is a succesful mixing of Bible stories (David and Goliath, Redemption), fairy tales (Sleeping Beauty),Shakespeare (Romeo and Juliet), Greek stories (the Amazons, the Spartans).  Mr Hicks is a real storyteller and he can tell a story with the best of them.  Even if usually you don't like SciFi (it's my case) you should read this book.  It's worth it!, This is the second installement in the IN HER NAME series an as the first book is an amazing story.  Mr. Hicks is a very talented writer and his characters are real people, with virtues and flaws.  The hero, Reza is not perfect but he is a wonderful person and the secondary characters are so interesting, they really enrich the story.  As I said in my comment of the first book I am not a SciFi reader but this series is THE exception for me. So, the conclusion is if you like fantasy, adventure, thriller, romance and evidently SciFi this book is for you., I could download this book for free during the ebook week.  Usually I don't read SciFi but it was free so I tried it because it had good comments.  I am so happy to have had the opportunity to read it!  It was a big and happy surprise!  I loved it, I couldn't put it down.  It's really very well written. The characters are alive and they engaged you from the first page in their adventures.  It's SciFi because of the environment but it's a solid novel.  Even if SciFi is not your cup of tea try this book it's worth it., As the other one star reviewer I can't understand the 5 stars given to this book.  It is very badly written, the characters are ditched by their fianc and lover and instead of being at least a bit sad they are attracted to each other instantly.  They were supposed to be in love with their respective lovers.  The heroine is this hotshot investor but she seemed so immature that I couldn't believe she was \"real\". Finally, I gave up and leave it because even if I bought it for only one dollar I considered I was wasting my time., Shelley Thacker puts magic in her books. The characters become alive between her fingers. In this book I laughed, I cried and I cheered for them. As in most of her books the plot is not as important as the characters, they are the ones that pull you in. I definitely recommend this book and I am waiting for the next one., Another great book in the series! Thacker never dissapoints. I have a new job and much less time to read but this book? I assure you once I began I couldn't stop, i read during my lunch time. At home the housework had to wait and the book took first place. It is sweet, hot has adventure, romance. Do you a favor and read it!, What a great story! I was a bit reluctant because of the subject, it's easy to turn it into something cheesy and ridiculous. But Ms Thacker did a wonderful job giving life to it.  It's credible, romantic, adventurous and I had a great time reading it. The characters follow a logical way to react given the circumstances, the sex scenes are really romantic and tasteful. I have also read her trilogy Stolen Brides, that I loved and I am happy not to be dissapointed. So if you like romances where the H and h have had a difficult begining in life, this is for you.\\nAnd after writing this review I've just bought AFTER SUNDOWN, the latest book.:), I won't summarize the story because some of the reviewers have already done it and very well.\\nFor me this is a new writer, it was the first time I read one of her books and I wasn't expecting much.  But I received a big surprise! The cover is not the best I've seen but OMG the story inside is one of the best I've read in a long time and it will stay one of my favorites of all times with the second book in this series.  The characters are endearing and real people with flaws.  There is one person here that gave this book one star based on the idea that the hero cheated on the heroine.  I think she haven't read the book at all because it is completely clear that the heroine thinks that the hero cheated on her and the operative word here is \"think\".  I almost didn't buy the book based on that review so do it yourself a favor and if you like time travel romances and very sweet stories with characters that are not perfect then read this book and you won't regret it., If possible this book is even better that the first one of the series.  The story and the characters are very endearing.  I am waiting impatiently for the third book.  I will add Ms. Thacker to my list of favorite writers and wait for other wonderful stories. I liked that this story was so different from FOREVER HIS and once I began reading I coudn't put the book down and it made me daydream.  It is a very sweet romance., I liked this story very much as the others I've read by ms Thacker. She doesn't disappoint in this book. If you liked the other two in the series you will love this one. A romance with w twist of the fantastic with no big surprises but very nice and true., I love the stories written by Elisabeth Naughton and this one didn't disappoint. The first part of the story is very hot and sexy but then you receive a punch on the gut with the secrets both characters are keaping from each other and that is what I love about her books, the characters are not some beautiful empty puppets but people with difficult past lives that put one foot in front of the other and kept going. So this book is short but powerful. I loved it, I love fairy tales so I began reading this book with great expectations but when I was about 25% into the book I was so bored that I couldn't continue reading.  The characters were boring and nothing happened in the first part of the book.  The heroine kept repeating that she found the heroe attractive but I couldn't really feel it. It felt forced. So sorry that the story didn't deliverd what it promised., This was a great reading.  Very well written with good characters this book was very difficult to put aside so I read it very fast.  It has a Christian tone but it is not invasive and it mesh well with the story.  Usually I don't like Christian fiction for its proselitism but this book don't really qualify as Christian fiction. It is a moving story of forgiveness and acceptance of the things we cannot change., I couldn't read more than 3 chapters.  It bored me so much.  It could be an interesting plot but something went wrong.  I think the talent to write wasn't in this book.  Sorry., This book has a great story to tell.  I fell instantly in love with Cassie and Grey.  Cassie is a very strong heroine who had to survive some very difficult situations and Grey became strong through the ordeal of being imprisoned for 10 years in solitary. Both of them have great strength of character, can empathise with others misery but they have also a sense of inadequacy and are spiritually wounded.  I could feel the connection between Cassie and Grey, the story is beautifully written and develops smoothly.  So, if you like a love story with a good adventure plot and with H/h not perfect, this a book that you will love., This a very different paranormal. I loved all the books on this series. You have romance, adventure and suspense.  The storyline works very well and the characters play their roles naturally with fluent dialog. If you are into paranormals you shlud like this series, Another terrific book by Teresa Medeiros. I liked this book much more than The Temptation of your Kiss. The hero is an engaging character, sweet and with a great sense of humor. The descriptions in this gothic are perfect and there is a combination of gothic air with the humor that characterises Medeiros novels. For those who have read  A Sicilian Romance you will find some touches there and one of the characters is reading TSR, I think this was a great touch. So I greatly recommend this book., I am a Medeiros fan and this book is one of her best.  It is not your ordinary romance:  beautiful heroine  meet gorgeous hero and blam! they fall in lust or love.  This is the story about two lonely people, each with some bagage (who hasn't have one?) and how they connect using Twitter.  How all began with superficial exchange and slowly they tell each other their secrets.  I laughed, I cried and in the end I was left wanting more but it is the end that it had to have for this story.  Ms Medeiros chose well.  I couldn't put it down.  Read it it's worth it., This is a very enjoyable story, sweet and entertaining.  It's my first Tina Folsom and I had it free for my Kindle and now I bought the second and third book from this series.  I really liked it and if you like vampires that are not perfect (this is a series where the vampires are a little different from the usual vampire hero) you will like this book., This second instalment was somewhat not as good as the first one but was worth reading. It felt like a repetition of the first one. But I am reading the third, Dying for a Daiquiri and am loving it!  So even if it is not great I repeat it is worth reading it. I liked the characters very much and the humour in the book feels natural not forced as in many books I've read in the past, It was a cute book, easy to read and I had an agreable moment reading it.  It's a book to read when you need to cheer up, on the beach, in the sun or you want to have a light read. Nothing extraordinary but not bad. The characters are pleasant, amusing and the fantasy world entertains. Somebody said that there were a lot of typos and grammar mistakes; I saw some but nothing that could distract from the story., I liked it but it wasn't a great book.  I don't know what it was that didn't do it for me.  The idea of the story was what catch me first, it made me think about Beauty and the Beast which is my favourite fairy tale.  So that is why I bought it. But there was something artificial in the atraction Maya felt for Gabriel. Don't think it is a bad story.  I found it entertaining and I read it very fast because it caught me but when I finished it it left me with the feeling that something was missing., One of the reviews said that maybe one of the older crowd would like it but nooooo.  I am one of the older crowd and this was boring.  The characters are boring, the writing is boring and the dialog is extremely boring.  It was free and I thought the theme would be interesting but no.  I couldn't finish it and believe me I tried., This book was a very nice surprise.  I downloaded it when it was free and I wasn't expecting something so good.  It's very well written, very witty and a romance that doesn't walk on the main road.  I had fun with it but also it made me think.\\nVery interesting and fun reading., This story reads as a typical romance but it has something that makes it interesting and keeps you reading.  There is some spice in it that took me on the ride.  There are some grammar mistakes and typos that could be easily corrected but nothing that will take you off the story.  At the end of the book though the things became a little too mushy and improbable trying to open book 2 and 3 of the series. But as my title says this author has potential and as this is, I think, a first book I will keep an eye on her and read her next books., I liked this first book very much but it needs some serious professional editing.  I think that the author will gain a lot to give this book to a professional editor and work with him/her because this is a book that has great potential.  I was really distracted by the bad grammar, the \"you're and your\", \"then and than\",  the change from past to present  tense in the same sentence, etc.  There were words and expressions wrongly used too.\\nIt reads at first a bit like a feminine Harry Potter crossed with Twilight.  There is some likeness to it.  Eden is an orphan who doesn't know she has magic and she was raised by her aunt. She is \"persecuted\" by a powerful and malevolent king and her grandfather \"concealed\" her to protect her (a bit like Dumbledore with Harry).  And there are some other elements like these but at some time the story takes off and it is really good.\\nI was hooked and bought the second and third book in this series.  It is really worth reading if you like fantasy, despite the bad grammar.\\nAs I said in the title the story is 5 stars but because of the grammar problems I can't give them., I received this book in exchange for an honest review.\\nThe story is a romance with a tiny bit of a mistery in the plot but mistery is definitely not the important part of the story. The beginning is slow but not bad.\\nH and h had had a relationship when they were teens that ended abruptly and badly. Now ten years later they end together at the place where all began when the father's H dies in an accident.\\nWhat I didn't like:\\n- this book needs proofreading, there are a number of errors that are really distracting, from sentence structure, typos to misplaced words.\\n- when finally the action begins, the way the things are presented are not interesting. Fr exemple, it would have been nice to explain the process of the research done to find evidence by the h. Instead all was presented as a fait accompli.\\n- the characters where not fully developed and sometimes the dialogues were a bit artificial.\\nMaybe if a good editor were to be given this book, something could come out of it., I've read 48% and i am thinking about abandoning it. I've really tried to finish it because the premise is interesting but, is this really happening in a college and the heroine is a 20 year old woman? She seems like 15 in high school.  The writing and grammar are not great either, there are many mistakes in each page. I think it would have been better to put the characters in a high school and give the book to an editor. So my two stars are because of the good premise without that it would had been a one star review., Nice story line. Made me smile and sometimes even laugh. It's the kind of book to read when you need something light to read. I've bought book number two of the series, Dying for a Dance and I am reading it., It's the third installment in this series and very good. I liked it better than the second one, Dying for a Dance. The action was in Hawaii with new characters added to the usual ones, the heroine brother and his wife and the decor was fabulous. So now I am waiting for the fourth one that I am sure I'm going to read., great book. a real page turner, Another exciting story!  After nine books Genevive and her team are  still going at it in a great way. I absolutely loved this story and am now waiting for the next one where I imagine we will have more about Vinnie. In this book we had a bit of Vinnie's past, how he got his scar.  The plot was exciting and convoluted but precise too. You can read the book alone but it would loose a big chunk of charm. You can have a look in the characters minds if you read all of them in order. This is one of the best series I've read., This is a romantic book with a lot of action.  So if you don't like romantic books don't read it.  But if you like a good romance but with something else, this book is for you.  The characters are well defined and very likable, the plot is well written and developed.  In two words, an enjoyable book., It was my first book by this author and I had it as a freebie so I didn't expect much but I was surprised when it resulted a surprisingly excellent romance.  The characters are lovable, the story is very sweet and I was laughing sometimes.\\nSPOILER ALERT!\\nThe only thing I didn't like was the storyline about David's dad and his wife and Daphne having arranged all the \"thing\" between Sophie and David. It wrung false and strange.  But it was a minor thing compared with the quality of the storytelling.  I will try other books by this author, definitely., Usually I am not a fan of Civil War romances but I decided to try this one because of all the five star reviews and the fact that the author contacted me by Facebook and I found her posts funny or interesting. So Here I were reading this story and let me tell you I loved every minute of it.  The characters are uber interesting and they interact in a natural way.  After having a chain of awful book reading this one was refreshing, I couldn't find even one grammar mistake.  Heaven!!! I know that this should be the normal thing but trust me, it is not. Nowadays books are filled with them and I think it is a way to tell the readers:  I don't respect you!  So this book has great grammar ;o), a great love story to tell mixed with history.  Then, a great combination.  And last but not least a great way of telling it., This is a very compelling thriller. I read it in one sit because I couldn't put it down. At the same time I have to say that it has explicit violence and at times it was difficult to read because of it but that it's just me. At the beginning of the story it feels a bit twitchy but it gets better after some pages. It is a good mystery and IMO it is worth reading., Again as I said about book one of these series the grammar is awful and the author has to hire a professional editor ASAP and there are some inconsistencies that need also to be sorted out. Only as an example, the underage characters order wine at a restaurant and nobody finds this strange.  As I understand in the States 16 or 17 is underage for alcohol consumption so I think that some explanation or change should be made here.  And the countless mistakes take away a big part of the quality of the book.\\nI've found this book better even than the first one but, and this is for Ms Higginson: I pray you, give your book to a professional editor.  You have a good book in your hands that could be great.\\nI loved this book and I am now reading the third one.  If you like fantasy, make yourself a favor and read these series., I loved this book. This is an outstanding story and different from any lo e story I 've read. Very well executed. The characters are alive and well developped. I recommend this book. It's been a long time since I gave a five star review., Shelly Thacker is one of my favorite romance authors and this book made me like her even more, if possible.\\nIt has it all: a fabulous plot wonderfully developped, damaged and mistrustful characters -- a hero who is a man with a difficult past and a heroine who suffered a lot- and great secondary characters who are worth their own book.\\nIt's an impressively well-written book. The description and dialogues flow so easily that you fall into the story from the first page. The love scenes are not only HOT but sweet and romantic.\\nAnd I loved the adventure that kept me on the edge of my seat! So do it yourself a favor and read it!, After 8 years Ms Canham is back with all guns out.  I always loved her books but after so much time without writing I didn't know what to expect.  But she is as great as always.  I absolutely loved Gabriel's and Evangeline's story.  This is a book that you must absolutely read if you like pirates, treasure hunting, adventure and evidently romance.  The characters are endearing and true, the adventure is engrossing and the romance is sweet and hot., I loved every one of the books in this series and the number 8 is no exception. It was a roller coaster and i couldn't put it down.  The characters endeared themselves even more in this book and OMG, the end is a wonderful cliff-hanger and now I don't know how I will survive the waiting for the next book.  I have to know what happens to Clarissa and how the \"angel\" that finds her will help her. I can't say more without spoiling the story for you. The books in this series keep becoming better and better.\\nThe only negative thing I have to say about this book is that there are still some problems with the grammar, YOU'RE vs. YOUR, to name one.  There are not a lot of them but still some must have run from the editor.  This in no way deter from the quality of the story but I think that it is something that could be corrected and give a better impression of the book., Awesome.\\n\\nPlenty of action.  I was astonished turning the pages.  I didn't know Ms Ryan was so good for action!  Quite a move.  Always delightful.  Thank you for the good book, yes. Once again., Sometimes when you have a perfect series you have to let it go at some point. The first ten books of this series were very good, I liked them very much. But this one fell short of the others. It felt like there was nothing new to tell so the situations were rigid and didn't feel right. The mystery wasn't really a mystery, you could see it right there. The best thing would have been to continue with Sean story, a really NEW mystery. I am sorry to give a bad review but I would like to give my opinion to other possible readers of this book. I think that Terri Reid is capable of better than this., Don't search for reality in this book.  I loved it as an escapist story and it made me sigh in pleasure.  This is a great book to read when you are on a vacation to escape reality and inmerse you in a great fantasy. It is a very sweet story, well written and it made me daydream. The characters,principal or secondary, are dears and engaging.  For me this author is new and now I am buying the next one in this series because I absolutely want to know Joe story. I highly recommend this book., I received a ARC copy in exchange of an honest review.\\nI am not going to write a blurb of the story as many of the reviewers alredeady did it. It gripped me from page one. The story is engaging with very well rounded characters that give you a wonderful ride through the storyline. It is a great story, very well written that will give you some wonderful hours of reading. Treat yourself and read it!, Sorry, but I couldn't read more than 8% of this book.  I was so bored I had to stop.  The characters did nothing for me nor the story., I loved this book.  It has great characters, good plots and humour.  The four stories are really good but the last one \"Second best\" touched my heart like not a book in a long time have.  This is a book that I would bring with me to a desert island and reread many times.  Wonderful and touching are the two words that come to my mind to describe it., I loved this book. It surprised me although it is not easy to do so in a mystery. Francis Bacon was a philosopher in the Elizabethan era and here he comes to life in a different situation. And why not? We have a story based on a real person and it makes a great character., I had this book for free because usually I don't read this kind of book.  The story was imaginative and great but I think it could be better with a bit of editing.  Some parts drag on and on and the parts where Ash think about Cathy's and Katrina's destiny are repetitive.  The begining is a bit slow but once you read 1/3 of the book the story begins to be really interesting., I loved this book! I liked to read one of my favourite fairytales in an adult version. If you like fairytales this book is for you., This is the story of an innocent young girl who falls in love and lust with an \"old\" man.  In the story the old man is only 41 or 42 but is presented as an old fat man.  The young girl is 18 and in a day she falls in love with him because he is very kind to her.\\nThe situation is not really plausible and the dialogues seemed forced to me.\\nI continued reading, because I forced myself to do it, about 75% of the book but I couldn't continue with it.\\nGael is a really nice man but please, to make us believe that an 18 year old girl will fall in love with him so fast and not only in love but in lust (she wanted to \"really\" be his wife) the narrator should have given us something more, more time or more drama or something.\\nAnd I am not the kind of person who needs fiction to be \"real\" but it has to be plausible in the situation of the book, the plot, the time line, again something.\\nI bought this book because of the title and the sample but was very disappointed.\\nI gave it two stars and not one only because the book has some good points, the atmosphere, the idea of the plot., I don't read short stories anymore, why? because there aren't many good ones out there! But here we have an exemple of very well written ones.  IMO to write a good short story is more difficult than to write a good novel. In a short number of pages the narrator have to achieve the difficult task of a good plot, define the characters, good descriptions and to catch the attention of the reader.  Here Ms Scott Taylor succeded to do it all. Even if I didn't love everyone of the stories I must say that they are all very well written.]</td>\n",

This was a fun addition to our camping trip in the Sierra's this Summer.  I don't know if it would be considered \"professional grade\", but it worked for us., It's white ribbon.  Quality is good., Initial review: This stuff is amazing.  If tames fly-aways, smoothes frizziness and speeds blowdrying.  I ue it every time I wash may hair.  I also use it on my duaghters hair as a detangler.  Unscented, very natural looking when your hair is dry.\\n\\nAdditional notes: After almost two years of use I stopped using this product.  I have heard the silicone can dry out your hair, and I did notice that when I did not have the product in my hair, it was more and more brittle.  Since discontinuing use, my hair has become less brittle and stronger.  I would no longer recommend this for every day use, though occasionally it's nice to get that super sleek look..., I don't know what people are complaining about.  We have had this peeler for 6 months, using almost daily for carrots, and often for potatoes and apples.  For the price it is a great deal.  Ours is stamped Linden Sweden.  I prefer that it is all metal, the rubber handles tend to become sticky and dirty., I don't know what people are complaining about.  We have had this peeler for 6 months, using almost daily for carrots, and often for potatoes and apples.  For the price it is a great deal.  Ours is stamped Linden Sweden.  I prefer that it is all metal, the rubber handles tend to become sticky and dirty., Well made and easy to wipe clean.  Kind of small - fine for a kids lunch, but doesn't hold much more than a sandwich and a few snacks.  (Maybe I'm a pig?) Only an 8 oz. bottle will fit in here., These are cute and sturdy tis.  They arrived on time and as described.  Some people are saying they are small.  The dimensions are clearly listed, and they worked fine for cookies.  I would buy these again., This is an updated review.  These sheets are super soft, however, after 1.5 years, the bottom sheet is completely shredded.  I don't know, I guess I expected them to last longer.  They were always washed on permanent press and dried on medium heat.  I'm bummed., This is super cute and easy to put together.\\nHowever, one of the bottom swirls arrived bent, so the tray didn't sit flat.  I carefully tried to bend it into place, and one of the connections snapped.  That being said, I think my husband can fix it, and I will be able to use it for the event I purchased it for this weekend.\\nThe fact that it can collapse is very convenient, and it really is a cute design.  I will use for cupcakes, and also as a centerpiece.  For the price, I am happy with the purchase.\\nI wold have gien 5 stars if not for the crumby construction., My box arrived on time with each piece individually wrapped.  Nothing was broken or damaged.  My only complaint is that the colors I received were very dark.  Not exactly as pictured., Arrived on time and as stated.  nice selection of polished amethyst.  the items I received looked jus like the image online., Fits my MacBook air, protects the computer.  Zipper is sturdy and fully functional.  Color is as shown.  It is neoprene, so it stinks.  Give it a few days to air out before using.  Great value., Well made backpack - beware that this specific color - Tahitian Orange - is a pink based orange - my son was having none of it.  Other than that, its a great pack., Well made, color is true to online image.  There are pencil keeper pockets sewn into in the small front pocket.  Double zipper on the large opening.  Functional and stylish., We went theough a winter with no leaks or cracks and hard wear and tear.  The soles are sturdy and they are wide enough in the shaft for my 2 year old to get them on and off herself., I have coveted Hunter boots forever, but could not bring myself to shell out over $140 for rain boots.  I settled on these b/c they were made in Canada (instead of China), had good reviews and looked cute.  Like other reviews mention, these are narrow in the shaft.  They are perfect with skinny or straight leg jeans on a thin legged girl.\\nThese run small.  I normally wear an 8-8.5 and ordered the 8. I should have gotten the 9.  The foot bed is just long enough with thin socks, and I almost had a panick attck trying to get them off the first time.  (The ankles are also narrow which makes them tough to get off!)\\nThe brown color is more like a black cherry, and it is actually a clear covering over the neoprene liner, which is a very cool look.\\nI have been wearing them daily in the creek (literally)  no leaks so far.  I would recomend these boots!, Perfect cotton socks with elastic.  True to size.  These have held up well, and my son is hard on socks.  They have padding in the footbed, which is a nice touch.  They go to mid-calf when pulled up all the way.  I will purchase again., Well made backpack - beware that this specific color - Tahitian Orange - is a pink based orange - my son was having none of it.  Other than that, its a great pack., A snug fit.  order up if you don't wan t it to be skin tight.  Nice bright color and decently send seams., Cute socks.  Good quality.  I wish they were more cotton, less other materials., Good swim trunks.  Color is vibrant, they are well made.  The waist tie is functional.  There is a brief mesh insert.  Cargo pockets are functional.  Fabric is lightweight and quick drying.  I would recommend these shorts., This coat is warm and thick without being super bulky.  I ordered the 10-12 for my tall 8 year old.  Sleeves are about right and the coat doesn't hang too long.  Hood is not removable.  Color is true to online image.  - we got the deep wave color.  Hood is adjustable, but not removable., These shoes are super cute, and really bright.  They almost seem to glow in the dark, which is fine with me. As with most ASICs, they are a little wide in the toes.  I have purchased the GT-2000 in the past, and loved them.  These could use a little more arch support.  Not a deal breaker, but I may buy some supports to add in., So much easier to throw this on than apply sunscreen over back and shoulders.  Great fit and it doesn't stretch out too much when wet.  Has held up well to multiple cold water washings and extreme chlorine exposure (community pool!)\\nThe chevron pattern on the back is slimming.  Very cute!, I ordered a medium/Large.  The robe is plenty wide, but the sleeves are just to my wrists - I am 5-8.  I'm afraid that when I wash, it'll shrink.  I'm afraid to order a Large/XL because i think the body of the robe will be huge., Terrible.  This bra has almost no stretch, which is exactly what a compression bra is supposed to have.  I wear a 34C.  I could barely get the size medium over my head.  (I do not have large shoulders.)\\nOnce the bra was on, it was extremely tight around my rib cage, but didn't stop my breasts from bouncing at all.  I would have thought that it was too large, but I had major side boob and I was also busting out over the top of the bra.  Sending back.  Sigh., These are nice under the Anglefish shoes, and don't show.  I wear an 8 1/2 shoe, so I ordered the med/large size, and they are a bit big.  I'd order the smaller size if I was to purchase again., This is a very basic slip.  Straps are not adjustable.  I would purchase in advance and make sure it works with the dress you need to wear it with.  Doesn't ride up.  True to size.  Did not generate stay cling.  A good foundation piece., I like the look of these shoes, but I don't think they provide as much cushion as the Asics GT2000 that I have worn in the past.  I've only had them a week, but I've gotten in several runs.  They just aren't great., This product is as described and was easy to put together - the horns and topping snap into place.  The horns are so large and heavy however, that it makes the hat unstable. It doesn't really stay on adults or children.  We bought this for my sons Halloween costume, and it won't stay on his head.  We have tried adding some foam padding inside the helmet, but it hasn't helped.  I think if he actually wants to wear it we'll have to poke holesin the sides and add an elastic band to run under his chin..., These definitely ran small, and were not super stretchy.  They were however truly metallic.  We used for the bottom of a robot costume., This is a great sweatshirt  Note it is mens sizing, and fit.  Classic puffy fit with fitted wrist and waist, which is what I wanted.  I am 5-8, 145 and I ordered the medium.  It was very large before washing, but has shrunken down, and is slightly fitted in the bust, but loose around the middle.  The color is vibrant burgundy.  You can use the hood., Arrived on time and as stated, but two of them had snags or broken when we tried to tighten the strings.  No liner, but fine a goodie or dice bags, This dress has an odd fit.  Cons: The cups are very long, and were not super flattering on me.  You can see gapping on some of the images posted by other reviewers.  Bottom half of the dress was super tight on the hips.  Straps are made of round elastic?\\nPros: Beautiful floral print.  The thick \"scuba\" material of the dress would hide flaws., This is a great summer top.  It is lose without being baggy, and looks \"put together\" while still being a cool cotton t shirt.  I ordered a medium - I am 5'9'', 145 lbs, the fit is just right.  Long enough and flowy, but still structured around the shoulders and bust.  The line down the center of the shirt is a little weird looking, I think I would have prefered it without, but I still like the shirt and will wear it lots this summer. I wish it came in more colors than the traffic cone orange and black..., This is a cute necklace.  The seashell opens, but it is very tiny, it would be hard to actually put a photo in it.  We ought this to wear for a Halloween Mermaid costume, and my daughter was very happy with it., Wow, I doubted this dress, but it is really great.  I ordered a medium - I am 5-8 145.  The fit is snug but not too tight.  The arm openings are a little odd, but for the price, not a problem.  The top is modest, and the dress hits at my knees.  These is no liner or petticoat, so it will need a slip.  The stitching is the back is a little off, but not noticeable and doesn't affect the fit too negatively.\\nSome people mentioned stains or marking on the light colored dresses - I did not see any of this., This dress is super flattering.  The pros: The pattern shift at the waist really draws it in.  The green color is vibrant and bold.  This dress is long, I am 5-9 and a large landed just above my knees.  This is kind of a good thing because it really hugs your curves, so having the dress be a little longer balances everything out.\\nThe cons: Thin material requires a slip if you are going to be wearing this outdoors in natural light.  it isn't see through, but it shows EVERYTHING.  I would have given 5 stars for thicker material.\\nOverall - for the price, a fantastic buy!, This is a cute, lightweight summer dress.  The yellow color is a deep sunflower, which isn't great for my skin tone, but is a very nice color.  I am 5-8, 140 and I bought the medium.  It fits well.  There is a mix of different textures and fabric mediums to the dress, which is fun.  The V in front is a bit deep, but not scandalous.  I have been machine washing and drying with good results., The long/tall feature is great if you have a skinny kid.  Finally pants that fit well, are well made and can withstand play.  My son is tall and super skinny.  These fit him and are a great price., This is a very cute and comfortable suit.  Fit is as expected.  I normally wear a 6 or 8, I went with an 8 and it is perfect.  There is a built in shelf bra with very firm removable pads.  I ended up removing them because I was afraid they would look odd when wet.  The suit is fine without the pads, or you could also use a different pair of pads/liners if you are concerned with nipple coverage.  The thin straps are adjustable, and have nice looking gold hardware.  My only complaint is that there could be a little more support in the bust.  The chef bra doesn't do much.\\nThe color is true to the online image, and is a nice vibrant purple.\\nThe shirring on the side is flattering.  I know some reviewers have compared it to maternity wear, however, if you have a somewhat fat stomach, it is fine.\\nRear end coverage is moderate, and flattering., This is a great kids sweatshirt.  It is thick and fluffy.  It shrunk a LOT though.  I ordered a 10-12 for my eight year old.  Before the first wash he was swimming in it.  After a wash and dry though, it is perfect.  Roomy, but not huge.  The color is vibrant green., Adorable and well made coat!  I would order up through if you want to ear a sweater underneath it, they run little small, I had to return and order up a size.  Color is super vibrant, buttons are functional., I am tired of little girls swim suits looking like Victoria's Secret. This swim suit is super cute and stylish -  while still being modest and comfortable.  (I kind of wish they had an adult version)\\nI would say these are true to size.  Well Made.  Not see thorough - which I was worried about with the white stripes.  The back is high and the straps stay in place., Adorable and well made.  Nice back zipper.  My daughter loves this dress. Runs true to size, Nice quality line shirt, but my husband usually wears  medium, and this was tight across the back, and he is slim.  Ending up sending back., Well made backpack - beware that this specific color - Tahitian Orange - is a pink based orange - my son was having none of it.  Other than that, its a great pack., These are perfect for a tall, slim kid!  They are cut narrower, so it doesn't look like a think child is swimming in them.  (both the waist and the width of the legs is skinnier.  These are great for my tall and slim son., Finally pants for tall skinny boys!  Another reviewer commented that these are like a size 8 waist with a size 10 length - this is true, and great.  My son is tall and skinny, and these are perfect.  He is 8, I ordered the 8 and they fit very well.  Adjustable interior hidden belt is helpful.  Note: back pockets are false - just flaps.  I am okay with this, and they actually fall better because of it.  Cargo pockets and front pockets are real.  I ordered another pair in the gray this week.  These are casual enough for every day, but could be dressed up for a more formal event., These look great and are comfortable enough to wear all day, though I found my feet to be sore the NEXt day after wearing them all day and walking.  They really do look great, and the heel height is tall enough to look professional without killing you.  Very well made - as you would expect from Cole Haan., This is a small backpack, for a child under 5 years old.  It looks rather cheaply made, but the zipers are still intact after 6 months.  My daughter uses it regularly., When wet, this top gets a little droopy.  Seems to be holding up well, and definitely protects from the sun.  Color in photo is true to life.  Wish I would have gotten a lighter color though, as it\\ns hot when not in the water..., This suit is very cute from the front.  the v neck is flattering, and the shelf bra is supportive.\\nFrom the back, the deep v low back is also very cute and flattering.  In fact, I love it!\\nThe issue I had with this suit is that the back bottom straps ran right across by shoulder bones, making the suit feel awkward and uncomfortable.  I tried pulling the traps down over, and up higher, but it just didn't work for me.  Bummer because otherwise I would highly recommend.  The fit might be different for other wearers, but I had to send it back., Very cute dress!  All cotton with a vibrant print.  Easy on-off with a stretchy neck and arms.  Pink sash is full removable.  My daughter loves wearing this dress and has gotten lots of compliments on it.  Knee length., I ordered the white version of this dress, for the price, it is well made.  The one size fits most is true - I am 5-8, 145 and the dress fits fine, however, the smocking doesn't go down as far as I would like.  Because of my height, the smocking doesn't go down to my waist and stops in an awkward spot on my rib cage.  That being said, I still wear it around, and I have gotten compliments on the dress.  I was hoping to wear to a wedding, but it just isn't that flattering.  HOWEVEr, if you are shorted, this dress would be great., Runs small compared to other kids clothes., Very cute girls dress.  Runs a little small.  It's hard to tell in the image online, but the lace and flowers are like graphically printed on the dress?  the effect is cute and stylish.  Dress is very light weight and would be good for summer.  My daughter likes it a lot.  The orange color looks kind of pink on line, but it is definitely more orange than red/pink.  This dress has a more sophisticated look than many little girls dresses, which I liked for a change., Bought these as a replacement for a pair I had worn completely through.  A true straight leg jean, good quality.  Inseam is about 33.5 inches on a size 29., My husband has switched to linen. Cool and soft.  Slightly roomier fit than he is used to, but not baggy.  It somehow manages to look relaxed and polished at the same time., Good quality and super cute.  I ordered a 6 for my soon to be 5 year old.  the cut is very long and slim which is nice, but if you have a heavier/shorter child, this might not be the best cut.  Or, order up.  Coat color is true to online image - a bright melon color.  Hood is not detachable.  Scarf is.  Fleece lining in the hood is a nice tough., Cute sandals that appear to be well made  - we did get blisters on the few first wears.  Also, the back zippers are tough to pull up and down.  I am hoping they will last through the summer.  The buckle are tiny, which look great but are a little hard to manipulate., These seem to have more stretch than other 7 jeans I have purchased.  I don't love the twill look, but the fit is excellent, so I kept them.\\nI purchased a 29, and the fit is perfect.  As a reference I am 5-8 and 145 lbs. These are ankle grazing., Very cute but the back heel cup goes straight up and down and it very stiff.  This left an odd gap between by heel/ankle and the shoe.  They just din't fit great.  I also had to pay to send them back, sad face., Great for pajama pants.  A little long, which is great for my tall/thin son., The sizing chart on this item is all crazy.  I ordered a 12 bassoon the sizing, and it was super large.  I returned it for an 8 hoping for a better fit.  Nice construction.  A bit see through - there is no liner.  Also, wish it came with a carrying case so I could throw it in the car.  BUT, still a cute alternate to boring rain coats., Nice style and well constructed.\\nThe pros: style, comfort.\\nThe blue suede is a nice light color, with a good contract to the white, but not so much that it limits the options of what I can wear them with.  I like that these do not have a bulky sole.\\nThe cons - they are leather, and though they are white shoes, my feet are kind of hot in them.  (no vents/mesh/perforations)\\nSizing: The sizing is average.  I would say these are slightly narrow, and perhaps run a little long.  I usually wear a 8/8.5.  I probably could have squeezed into an 8 in these.  I bought the 8.5 and they are a nit long, but still fine.)\\nI would purchase these shoes again., Fun suit. Comes with very awkward pads that can be removed.  Back is adjustable. I wish the bottom seem was a little more substantial, it feels like the top could ride up.\\nBottom run small and are super low cut.  I plan to wear the top with a plan black bottom.\\nPretty well made for a suit that costs under $20., This runs small, it is more like a tunic than a dress.  The material is some sort of synthetic.  The print is vibrant though and the dress is very cute overall.]</td>\n",
       "      <td>[This coat is a great deal.  Good craftsmanship, nice sturdy fabric.  The details - cinched waist, hood toggles, zippers, and lined pockets really make the jacket look nice.  True to size - I ordered a large - I am 5-8, 145.  Arms are a bit snug when wearing a sweater underneath.  This coat is a steal at the current price of under $30., This dress is adorable, but runs a bit small.  My 4 .5 year old daughter was too big for a size 5, and she sent super large or heavy for her age.  Pattern is nice though, and the detail around the neck is cute., I have been using these for about a month and a half, and have been happy with their performance.  No leaking.  They do fog up about every 10 minutes, but a quick rinse clears them out.  I have not tried to adjust the bridge pieces which came with the goggles.  I was worried that the pink tint of the lenses would be annoying, but it's not bad at all.  These stay put through lap swimming, and are not so tight that they leave horrible marks around my eyes post-swim.  I have not worn them while diving into the pool - so I can't recommend how they would fair for competition., Runs small - my 60 lb son who is skinny as a rail couldn't get into it, and we are used to hearing life jackets.  Otherwise, a quality made perfectly decent life jacket., Good quality but runs small.  My daughter weighs 40 lbs and has a 23 inch chest, so she us well within guidelines for the child vest, however this was super tight on her.  Otherwise good quality life jacket., TI bought these for my son for batting practice and catch.  These have been fine for practice, and hold up well.  They are a soft core and much bouncier than a true baseball.  We use them for batting, so that is fine.  For fielding practice, they are just okay, as they don't mimic a true base ball - again, the bounciness.  I would recommend them for kids who are still earning to catch, because they are soft., Fits my thick legged 2.5 year old great, she is about 24lbs.  The fit is snug without chaffing.  It looks like a bikini breif bottom.  The fabric is loose, but the legs and waist are tight enough to contain any accidents (Though we have not tested this yet..!)\\nIt seems to be holding up well after multiple cold water/gentle washes in the washing machine., Well made, color is true to online image.  There are pencil keeper pockets sewn into in the small front pocket.  Double zipper on the large opening.  Functional and stylish., This sleeping bag appears to be really well made.  We washed it, per the instructions and the batting stayed in place. The liner is super soft.  The bag comes completely apart into two separate pieces for washing.  It comes with a compression sack.  Weight is about 15 lbs, and it is HUGE.  definitely for car camping, not backpacking., This suit had a matte finish that I was not fond of.  Like most competitive type suits it is very tight.  Support was decent and the suit appears to be well made, but I ended up returning the suit.  It is definitely a skimpier fit than many lap suits but was flattering., Very well made.  Easy to adjust straps.  Comfortable, but takes a while to dry.  I think we'll get several summers out of this vest.  Fit my tall and skinny 9 year old well., good quality and excellent price for youth soccer ball.  The color has faded, but the ball is holding up well., I ws pleasantly surprised with the quality of this product.  We ordered the purple leotard with flutter sleeves.  It is true to size and well constructed.  I would buy more products from this company., We've bought several of these t shirts now, they are well made and affordable.  Seller ships promptly (mine were not prime) and will give you a shipping discount for multiple items (as in you are not charged the full shipping price for each item if you buy a bunch all at once.), Bought these for warm up batting practice before our minors team games.  One fo the balls is already split after 1 day of use.  They are $2-3 cheaper per dozen than our local sporting goods store, not sure if the quality is better or not.  They are regulation baseball size., Well made life vest.  Fit my 6 year old 40 lb child well.  Lots of room to expand sizing.  Neoprene is more comfortable than the standard itchy block foam with nylon cover.  Only issue is that they take a while to dry., Unhappy with this coconut oil - off odor, off color.  I have purchased many different brands and refinement levels, but have not encountered one with a smell like this.  it just smells old and a little rancid, nit the sweet fresh coconut smell of other oils.  I'm bummed because Spectrum usually does a great job.\\nAlso, this doesn't say it is edible anywhere on the packaging.  OF COURSE COCONUT OIL IS EDIBLE - BUT Normally oils processed for human consumption rather than skincare/beauty say so on the packaging.  And oils processed for consumption are subject to different regulations for processing cleanliness, safety standards, etc.  This doesn't talk about the heat level it can beed on in cooking, or mention cooking or eating with it.  But it's sold in the food category.  I would be interested to see what Spectrum has to say about this.  Bottom line, I would not purchase again., These came with only about a month left before they all expired.  So they were not super fresh, and now we have to eat 6 boxes on 2 months, which was not the plan.  I would not order again.\\nThis is an Amazon inventory issue, not a critique of the taste of the bars when they are actually fresh., I bought these to round out a SnS order.  The cookies tasted good, and were in two smaller packages within the box.  Sadly about half the cookies were broken.  (fine for eating, not great presentation.  I think this could have happened in transit)\\nFlavor is good though!  Buttery, fresh, crisp.  Much thinner than Walkers., I didn't realize it, but this flavor has the bottom dipped in frosting/caramel flavor, which tastes good, but makes a big mealy mess.  the flavor was good, but this box tasted a little stale.  I prefer the maple pecan, which don't have the dipping, just a slightly sweet flavor., I love that these are not too sugary, but still taste great.  Also, no melting like the chocolate varieties.  BTW - there is nothing \"spicy about these, they are just a light vanilla flavor., I didn't realize it, but this flavor has the bottom dipped in frosting/caramel flavor, which tastes good, but makes a big mealy mess.  the flavor was good, but this box tasted a little stale.  I prefer the maple pecan, which don't have the dipping, just a slightly sweet flavor., I love that these are not too sugary, but still taste great.  Also, no melting like the chocolate varieties.  BTW - there is nothing \"spicy about these, they are just a light vanilla flavor., These do the job for a quick caffine fix. Not too acidic.  (no sad coffee belly).  They are alittle sweeter than I'd like, (Like 2 sugar packets).\\n But the cream level is just right.\\nYOU must have them chilled., I didn't realize it, but this flavor has the bottom dipped in frosting/caramel flavor, which tastes good, but makes a big mealy mess.  the flavor was good, but this box tasted a little stale.  I prefer the maple pecan, which don't have the dipping, just a slightly sweet flavor., I love that these are not too sugary, but still taste great.  Also, no melting like the chocolate varieties.

BTW - there is nothing \"spicy about these, they are just a light vanilla flavor., My kids love these books, they are spooky without being scary.  The characters are relatable.  Good for grade 1-2 depending on the kids reading level.  My third grade son can read through one of these in an afternoon, but still likes the stories., My son was able to put the hammock stand together in about 15 minutes.  It is comfortable and compact.  I know it is called a double hammock, however two adults is a tight fit.  You really could pack it up in the carrying case and take it camping, etc.  Cotton fabric is as shown and the adjustable hooks are a nice feature.\\nThe only flaw we have found is that the back side of the adjustable hooks can actually rub on the fabric of the hammock if you are laying far to one end or the other.  I think that eventually this could cause rips/holes, but you could either cover the bolts or just be aware of where you'r laying on the hammock.  This is not a deal breaker for us at all.  Overall, good construction and a great buy., Table and chairs came fully assembled and ready for use.  They are not as sturdy as other similar sets with a higher price that I have seen in person, but I believe these will hold up fine.  My issues was with the paint.  It was scratched off in several places on the chairs, and you can see there is no base coat/primer, so I wonder how long the finish will last.  There are also a couple small spots where the paint doesn't cover the metal at all.  Likley we will have to repaint them in a year or two., Easy to install and has worked with heavy use for 3 months.  For the price, this faucet is great.  it does feel a little light weight, however, you can't tell by looking at it.  No leeks!, A fun toy.  Chest is a nice size for a 6-8 year old to carry around.  maybe a foot print of 12x8 inches?  The clasp works well, and the false floor was fun for my kids to discover.  The coins are a little cheap looking, but fine for play.  Some people have commented that the finish on the box is not as pictured, but mine is very close., These are good quality markers.  Note that they are SMALL!  Pip Squeaks, as in little.  Each marker is only about 4 inches long with the cap on.  So about 1/2 the size of the regular skinny Crayola markers.  Obviously they have less ink than a standard carrel marker.  But, we bought these to take on vacation, so the smaller size was perfect for travel.  There are 64 markers in the box, and it says that there are 64 distinct colors.  I have to say that several of them look identical on paper, even though the cap colors are different.  Overall, a good marker for a good price, and I am happy with the purchase.  I would buy again., Mi kids love this game, it is fun and easy to play.  put the tree together, thread the sticks through the holes, drop in the monkeys.  They will play for a good hour or so, fun for adults too.  My only complaint is that it's kind of hard to get the two sides of the palm tree to snap together.  Also, the stick are sharp on the ends, not for kids under three unless COMPLETELY supervised., This was a gift, but our family friend said her two boys - ages 7 and 9 love them.  They shoot far and have not yet broken any wndows with them...  So just wild enough for good times., My kids love the Playmobil brand.  The details are great, and for being so small, the items are quite durable.  This set includes everything pictured, a great start to a \"farm\" or a stand alone play item.  If you child still puts things in their mouth, beware - there are small parts!, These are huge and silly, perfect for kids.  They are clearly plastic, but a nice heavy weight.  We recieved a variety of colors, but no rubies, sadly., These are well made little cards and perfect for toddlers, soft and cloth covered, you can wipe them clean.  The wheels roll surprisingly well.  They come in a little semi-disposable case, which makes toting them along easy., Nice idea, but the tops of the eggs come off at the slightest touch, so the ink has dried out, and I keep finding either a stamp, or an ink pad in random places.  If they stayed closed, I'd give it 5 stars..., I like the idea, but this isn't very well conceived.  Ariel can't stand up, and it's hard to make the bottom of her\"dress\" stick to her waist.  Her chariot is okay, but again, she ca't really stay upright in it very well.  The extruder tool was not super is kind of difficult for my 4 year old to operate.  Play-Doh was fresh, and the colors were fun.  This is fun, but I probably would not purchase this item again., These are the mini tubs - other than that, good color selection, very fresh and reasonable priced., Per other reviewers, the perfume bottle did not work for us.  Also, it makes a giant mess.  The bottle doesn't make a puff of moisture, it makes a stream of water.  That being said, the doll has been a hit and the perfume bottle has become a bath toy.\\nSkirt comes off, the top is molded onto the body of the doll.  The hair is nice, and the crown is removable.  Good quality for the price., These are fun, but the metalic raised stickers seem to stick better to our hardwood floor than the plastic brebraceletts.  A fun project for kids 3-8.  Plenty of stickers.  One pack kept the kids busy for about a half hour, and they enjoyed playing dress up with them after the initial art project.  These would be a good party project., This is a fun kit, and my 8 year old was able to put it together fine.  But it doesn't stay together well.  I would say it is more for looking at than actually playing with., This is a fast and fun project.  East clean up and nice soaps.  the soap mold are really tiny though, definitely kid size or guest bathroom, lol.  We just did the basis soap the first time, but are excited to try out different additions like scented oils and herbs.  Soap is gentle on skin, very kid friendly., Two of the three color packs were the same, and they were all little firm - not sure fresh.  However, the kids were happy and the +/- $17 was a decent price with free Prime shipping., Perfect gift for an 18 month old.  She was able to pull the caterpillar and maneuver the blocks without a problem.  It is engaging and sturdy., This is a lot of legos.  Santa delivered these to our kids this Christmas, and they have played with them for hours. This is a great addition to existing sets, and also great for kids with imaginations - it doesn't come with instructions, you have to come up with your own designs.  Note, the box doesn't function as a storage box, you need a plastic bin or something to keep the legos in.\\nThere is a wide range of colors and shapes in this kit.  They are packaged by color in smaller bags inside the larger box.  I would recommend this product for lego lovers.  it is also more cost effective than buying smaller kits/boxes., Better quality than some of the barbie type dolls we have ordered.  The hair is nice and think, we are hoping it will hold up in the tub., My daughter loves this.  It really is like 10 feet long and about 18 inches wide.  There are perforations so you can rip it apart if needed, but we've left it long for coloring.  The crayons that come with it are not good, so plan on using your own, or purchasing them separately., This is nice flower press.  My 5 year old is able to use it on her own without assistance.  The wing nuts are a little tricky, but she can handle them.  We've done 3 or 4 bunches of flowers and ferns all with good results. You can use the paper between the cardboard presses again and again.  We have made than you cards and other art projects with the pressed flowers, For some reason the horse always comes unattached from the wagon.  Other than that, great fun.  The details of the buggy whip and harness are nice.  The wagon rolls well.  My 6 year old was able to assemble the set for his little sister., Good quality and cute.  Animals and tree arrived on time and as described.  They are \"beanie baby\" sized.  God for kids maybe 3-6?, These are good quality and arrived on time and as described.  The kit came with the little screw driver to take the wheels on and off.  I din't get the appeal of this particular toy, but my son and his friends love them., This is a very basic book, for ages 2-3.  My daughter enjoyed it., Introduces images and words for common household items and animals.  Pictures are bright and large.  Pages are sturdy and can take a beating.  I would recommend this book.  Lots to look at!, Easy to turn pages and big bright images.  Good for kids who want to look at \"real\" things.  1-2 years, but also good for beginning readers, matching image to the word., My kid will not put these books down.  Great for beginning chart books.  Mysterious without being scary or gross.  My second grader loves them., My 8 year old loves this book.  It is full of random facts with great images.  He has thanked us for it several times (This is uncommon, lol!)  Easy enough for him to read to his sister, who is 5 and enjoys looking at the pictures.  Great for the child who love to learn, and also is constantly asking questions - what is the fastest train?  Where is the hottest place on earth?  How long is an anaconda?  The list goes on..., This has some new, some old, all innocuous kids jokes.  I would say 10 and under will appreciate it the most.  This has been fun for my 8 and 5 year old., My husband used this to study (and pass) his contractors licence test.  He said it was helpful and will likely use it as a reference in the future., My kids love this book, the pictures are great.  It is true that there are very few words, you don't really need them.  It's mini people building a cake, super cute.  Good for ages 2-6, All of the A to Z Mysteries are good for early carport books.  Spooky and a little mysterious without being truly scary.  I can let my kids read them without worrying that there will be weird stuff in them., My kids love these books, they are spooky without being scary.  The characters are relatable.  Good for grade 1-2 depending on the kids reading level.  My third grade son can read through one of these in an afternoon, but still likes the stories., I think it's weird, but my eight year old enjoys this series.  Nothing too spooky, but excitement and adventure.  Think Clive Kussler for elementary school..., My son cannot put thee down.  They are exciting and spooky without being gross or scary.  James Bond meets Inspector Gadget with a dash of Ramona Quimby.  The sibling interaction is nice and believable.  The \"bad\" adults aren't too bad.  There is a little tiny bit of actual history involved.  I would recommend this book and the series.  I have been reading them along with my son.  They are not Pulitzer prize, but they are entertaining.]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[Too hard - cracked, Beautiful burgunday color.  I have purchased at least 6 of these mink blankets over the years.  You will not be disappointed., Beautiful way to add a little Christmas to your wardrobe., I paid $7 for these and you can't even buy good pills inserts that cheap. very nice., I always wanted one and now I have one.  It is accurate and is also nice to use just as a timer., Great for desk at work. Light, quiet., Not as easy as the other one I had where rubber bulb screwed on., I love this thing - I use it constantly.  The battery lasts for around 15-18 minutes.  You may not think that is a lot, but for quick cleanups it is perfect.  It can't replace a big vacuum, but for a quick clean up of dog hair or crumbs....excellent!, Bought these years ago...bought a set here when I ran across them. Come in handy and work well., Didn't read close enough. Thought it was a cordless like my other one. Decided to keep it to use upstairs plug works fine in that area, Perfect for someone with no counter space....., Beautiful set. A bit lighter than I expected, but definitely non stick. Haven't put in dishwasher yet., Perfect fit  - worked well.  Pretty easy to replace old one., Works just like it says - roll little balls, put in small muffin tins and use the tamper - works perfect., This one is loud when it is on high and doesn't have an automatic sensor.  Go with the Airinstinct HEPA Large Room Air Purifier.  I have that one too and wish I would have just gotten two of those.  I know this one has a lifetime filter, but it is loud on high - too  loud., If you are debating whether to get this one or the Dual Max Air Purifier with the lifetime filter - go with this one.  It is much quieter and it has an automatic sensor that adjusts as needed.  Kinda looks like a giant iPhone and the color sensor lets you know the degree of odors it is filtering., Nice burgundy color. Fit queen bed well., It is a marked improvement over the French Corningware that doesn't have handles - got it for a great price. Went back to order one for my daughter and it wasn't available at that price., Such a simple idea and so darn cute.  I have several different kinds on my window sill at work and I love them.  Everyone comments on them.  I tell them I stare at them and go to my happy place - you can't help swaying along with them., Hubby loves this on his recliner. Second one I ordered so he can rotate. I was in regular washer., It is quiet - not a very \"strong\" air current.  I bought for the kitchen, but ended up moving it to the bedroom for night time use., Love these mugs. Bought the set in September. I broke the blue one and came back to order another set and the price has just about doubled. I paid $22 for the set of 6 mugs. Not ordering again unless the price drops drastically., Beautiful. Fits my queen bed perfectly. Love it.\\nIt's a little more on the red side than burgundy but it matches my bedroom great., I do like having these utensils easily accessible on the counter and that magnets hold them together., Nice burgundy color, soft, washes well. Great sheets for bargain price., Great price for soft, beautiful sheets.  I ordered two more sets. Burgundy color is true burgundy., It is very pretty, but much more purple than burgundy.  The color was listed as burgundy red - not maroon.  Was going to return, but decided to keep to use somewhere else.  Wish it came in more of the burgundy color as the other Chanasya throw I purchased., I put two of these on my glass top stove to avoid the fingerprints, and unfortunately little cat paw prints and smudges that always show up., It holds garbage....so that means it works!, Nice. Fit queen size well. Not sure how it would go in a king. Came back for s navj blue one. Brown is a rich dark chocolate., It is big and locks securely.  The handle is perfect for taking along to picnics or gatherings.  You will not be disappointed with this item.  I am thinking of ordering another one., Melted every time I used them., Perfect addition to my Rachael Ray set.  Definitely dishwasher safe - not discoloration., I like it - but the top part could be a bit bigger to accommodate cups that should stand up - like for soup.  Bpttom part is very large and fits lots of stuff!, Wish I would have known about these prior to all the shams I bought to match comforters and such expense prices - I will definitely just go to these to order a color that matches the print of the comforters and quilts., Love the clock...first one came cracked. Second one never kept time correctly. I ended up ordering new clock guys to put in myself. No more loud ticking noise with this fix either. Kept it because I loved the look of the clock., Love these.  Perfect to freeze when you make big batches of soup or chili and want to grab one to take to work for lunch., I used to love them.  Until the one earbud stopped working....just a few months into owning them., Got the blue one...very nice sky blue shade I might add, to replace a red apple cover I stained. It is very comparable. Still have no idea what the little bag of gizmos and gadgets that came with it are for. Some little things to plug the holes for the headphones and charging adapter I'm guessing. But no idea what the little blue thing is that looks like a fish skeleton or the thing that looks like a paper clip....does anyone know. Came without any directions for instal of cover...lucky fir me I'm pretty self sufficient....just be sure attach the back to the front before putting it on. Install takes seconds., I prefer a gel pen - but these are great when you are using a iPad or iPhone and using a pen at the same time to jot down notes on paper.  Like these much better than the ones with the stylus on the top., Variety makes this product very nice.  I use it instead of a lanyard for my id tag at work., Color is perfect - definitely size up.  I usually wear an XL - I bought a 3X.  I have ordered many sweaters in this style - sizing differs, but they are definitely made small., Bought these in several colors. Some fit better than others  made small. Took some time for delivery. I'd order again., Nice sweater. Definitely size up. I got a 3XL because I like them roomy. I wear a large...this fit like an XL, I ordered an XXL - I usually need a L to fit like this one did.  Well made and very true hunter green color.  Also ordered a royal blue - also a very true color., Beautiful green color, long enough for leggings., I got them for my second hole in my ear - so they are perfect for that.  I had another pair, but lost one so I priced one in a jewelry store and they wanted almost $70 for one to match.  I would recommend for the the quality and price., I bought this snowflake to replace one I lost.  Found the other one, but actually like this one more than the one I originally lost.  It is very sparkly and very pretty., Actually had to order a new pair, since I lost one from the set my son bought me!  At least now I have an extra one!, Nice, but very clunky and noisey links on handle., Christo did a fantastic job making sure I had exactly what I wanted. The bar was a bit smaller than I had expected, but I think I like it even more this way.  Very delicate a dainty. He made a small adjustment to lengthen the necklace a bit for my taste. It was perfect. I ordered a cheap one months ago from another seller because I couldn't find what I wanted and was afraid to order a real gold one on line. I'm glad I took the chance with Jewelery Affairs. I would not hesitate to do business with them again. Ordered on a Tuesday, custimiized and delivered on Friday., I have another brand that is the supposed to be the same size and they fit so much better than these.  I ended up sending these back and just cutting the toes out of the ones I had.  Just seemed more comfortable without the toes.  I used them after vein surgery., Wish they were a little looser at the thigh....better yet, wish I had smaller thighs!, Its big and it's heavy but it has been a life saver keeping track of my cat when he gets out at night., Love the pump instead of pouring.  Perfect fit for Torani and DaVinci brand 25.4 oz bottles, Love the pump instead of pouring.  Perfect fit for Torani and DaVinci brand 25.4 oz bottles, Yummy, I bought Donut Shop Coffee because of the sample that came with my Keurig that I loved.  I must say that from the first cup I had from this 50 pack it was defintely not the same quality as the sample I tried.  Now I am fearful of buying the 50 pack boxes.  And I am new to the Keurig - did not know the price of the 50 pack had gone up so much - at $30.00 a box now, doesn't seem worth trying another kind.  Now I am just plain scared of wasting my money on a 50 pack for fear that the same thing will happen with another flavor.]</td>\n",
       "      <td>[I really love this stuff.  In the long run it saves me money and time from stopping every morning for a mocha.

Coconut flavor is good, but could be a bit stronger., I had a more expensive charger before and it had a flashlight on it.  The button was constantly being turned by accident in my purse and when I needed it, it was dead.  Eventually it quit charging.  I like this one - simple and easy to use, not to mention about a 1/3 of the cost I paid for the one I got from QVC., Don't be an idiot like me and forget to take the clear plastic covering off of the inside and outside and complain to the company that it scratches......they told me, I looked, and they were right.  The only thing I didn't like is that it originally said the color was gold and then they changed it to honey almond...definitely not gold - kind of an ugly tan!  But well made!, Fits the iPhone 6 Plus perfectly., Really like this....except for the bright blue light illuminating from where the USB's plug in.....bad design for to use in a bedroom, unless you want a very bright night light.  But as for it's operation - works great!, I realize this was to keep your iPhone waterproof, but I wanted it to wear when I walk the dog and want to wear earbuds to listen to music or talk while I'm walking  and you can't close the top because it is suppose to seal tight - so it works very well....but I wish there was an option to put the earbud wire through., Very pretty, better than a lanyard for ID tags., much better than wearin ga lanyard - very nice and well made., Beautiful and very well made.  I would recommend to anyone that has to wear an ID laynard and wants something meaninful, well made and beautiful., I use to give my puppys pills with.  Just squirt it on the table and she licks it right up.  A lot easier than scooping out pb everyday and dirtying a spoon... and of course then I have to take a taste of PB too., Huge and heavy!, Bailey loves it ans washes up much easier than this either foam beds that you can never quite get back together., We have this in all three sizes and some days it looks like a squirrel massacre in our house - squirrels everywhere.  She absolutely loves these.  Though I do have to say these are definitely chipmunks, not squirrels, but she doesn't care!, Stays put and is perfect size for our Golden pup., Would have been great if our puppy would have used it!, Bought the small one to put in the back of a crate for our golden with some diarrhea issue.  It helped keep the mess contained., Works like a charm - but three gallons of water is very heavy to handle when putting back in the holder.  But for three big dogs it is definitely what I needed., Too expensive for me to feed my cat daily, but great to fill his treat containers....he loves it, Broke after two week use.  Dog was under recommended weight - but the plastic still cracked and the wire broke., I have three big dogs and this is a replacement set after having the others for over 5 years.  So much better than a buckle or clip collar - have never had a problem with them breaking or the girls slipping out of it., I have three big dogs and this is a replacement set after having the others for over 5 years.  So much better than a buckle or clip collar - have never had a problem with them breaking or the girls slipping out of it., No real texture, pup not thrilled with this one., A lot bigger than I thought it would be - too big for a golden puppy!  She'll grow into it though., No real texture, pup not thrilled with this one., A lot bigger than I thought it would be - too big for a golden puppy!  She'll grow into it though., Pup liked them at first and then turned her nose up at them., Found these when looking for a chicken treat from my dogs made in the USA.  Ordered them for several months and then they were out of stock - Unfortunately they came back at almost twice the price that I originally paid for them.  They were only 8.97 a bag and now they are almost $15..  I will  probably continue to order until I find something equal in quality but cheaper in price - but now they only get one treat a day instead of two so I don't have to order as often.  Why such a price hike?, My kitty hates the shrimp one and not real thrilled with the snapper - not sure what the problem is with those choices.  I'll stick with the chicken and tuna flavors., Pedigree products have caused issues for our black lab. Used for years and in the past six months she's become extremely anxious, thirsty all the time, restless, gassy. Researched online and it seems pedigree was behind these issues in many dog's recently.  Pedigree canned has changed their recipe recently to homestyle and since then her gas issues have gotten much worse. Quit feeding pedigree for two weeks. Only gave Hamburg and rice and then introduced purina one.  Vast improvement. Will not feed her pedigree again., Buy it and if you have big dogs get the large one.  I fill it every 3-4 days and I have two labs., Cute as a bug!  But didn't light up when I tried it. Ended up taking the top off and readjusting the wires so they made better contact. Good as new!  Love it., Cute - puppy loves it!, Seemed to finally take the smell away from the spot my sick dog had a nasty accident  on!  Worth a shot, Very cute - dog let it on the whole time, Works like a charm - but kind of expensive for plastic!  But It is definitely worth not having to go out in the cold and untangle the dog., Pup like this one - loves to gnaw on the texture., great price - works perfect., Fit by 100 lb black lab very well - with much room to spare., the cat enjoyed the festive look - fit well, Huge - worked well under couch covers for new puppy., Lasted 10 minutes for our 6 month golden retreiver!, I loves these lights.  Have ordered several over the years., I loves these lights.  Have ordered several over the years., Love them., Used this to fix the sunflower clock I got from Amazon. Easy to put together and no annoying ticking! Keeps time great!, It's very nice. More black than bronze., Very cute - but double the price at Lowe's.  Lowe's did not have the bronze one so i opted to pay the extra cost for the color that matched., Not too bright and one set doesn't work all the time - loose wire., Perfect...came back for 2 more sets!, Just plain cute.  They are so hard to find in the store and I have it sitting in my office on the window sill.  Everyone comments and asks where I got it.... I love it., Owls are the big craze now and I collect solar motion toys.  This one is my favorite...much nicer than the ones you find in the dollar stores.  Worth the money., I really enjoyed this book. It's not the great American novel...but enough twist to keep you interested., So glad I picked this book as my Kindle First choice for December.  It was a very quick read and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  There are no chapters, but there are break points .  I usually tell myself one more chapter - and then I definitely have to go to sleep.....so this was a bit harder to put down.  The story is about a veteran who knows what he did was wrong and he just wants to fix it.  He can only really tell one person and he does it by writing to this person.  Of course, he knows the answer all along, but it isn't easy to undo something once it is done.  Fate has a way of taking over.  Don't hesitate, this is a very good book., A bit expensive since you have to provide the pillow - but i like the look and quality of the case., Beautifully written love story.

Great set and customer service! Definitely a quality set..., I love how easy it is to buy and use the Amazon gift cards. I've never had a problem with balances or anything like that. If you have and use a Kindle a lot, definitely worth keeping one for purchasing books!, Balls are a good size and don't hit against my teeth like metal balls! They're also really pretty!, The chain is pretty short, but otherwise I love this collar. It will look lovely on my pet..., Arrived on time and seems very fancy. My husband is going to love this set and feel like hes a real chef...just has that feel and look!, Very pretty but on the small side., Love it....perfect fit and sexy!, If I could give this less than one star I would. I thought I was reading child porn. I guess I don't see an 18 yr old high school student as an adult. I surely don't want to read about them masturbating. Couldn't even finish this book.  Just felt wrong!, But I would have liked it a lot more if in the end Macy would have gotten a tattoo. If you've read the book Wrong Bed, Right Guy and you liked it, you'll enjoy this book as well., What can I say? It's a predictable book, but still an enjoyable read. I felt that Ethan was genuine and real with his feelings for Amy. Even when it was a sham, I could tell he had real feelings for her, which is why although I loved the book I didn't like Amy. She was so doubtful and just ridiculous! All of her questioning his motives instead of appreciating his actions was annoying!, So I almost didn't finish. It's listed as a contemporary romance, but it's really just lust at first sight (at least first sight as adults) and not enough story to make you believe that it turned into love. I mean I've heard the saying the best way to get over one man is to get under another but I don't think it's meant to be taken literally. I mean who gets dumped on their wedding day and immediately starts feeling attraction and lust and want for another man. I mean who does that sober? I didn't like how that unfolded or came about straight from the start, but I also didn't like Jenny's character. There was really not other way to put it, she was a gold digger. She was looking for security (financial) and she became someone else (and hid her family) in order to marry someone she didn't even look and who she felt she had to become someone different for. That's not love...I didn't get love from anywhere in this story. I usually love the hero in most romances, but Colton didn't even get me excited. You rescue a damsel in distress and the first thing you think about is bedding her...boooo!, Especially at Christmastime. It made me wistful. Although I thought it was a short time to fall in love, the story fit well with the idea of Christmas magic. I also liked that there was no drama, well there was but nothing drug out. Perfect Christmas romance!, This is a cute, fun love story. From the beginning the relationship between Bri and Ryan is explosive. Of course, it's kind of predictable, but still a really good read. It even has a few steamy parts for those loving for something a little sexy!, And this book got the bill.\\n\\nFinally a book I could get behind the heroine. Nice little romance even if the author didn't give enough character to the leading male for me to really see why Margaret was in love with him. I guess being tall, dark and handsome was enough., Like the first book, this one also takes you on an emotional rollercoaster. Jason Ryker is the type of husband every girl dreams she'll find!\\n\\nKate is stronger than she realizes and an awesome example of girl power! She has her issues but she works it out with the support of her husband,family and friends? Great story and characters throughout. Definitely a little steamer than book one!, But Gillian doesn't get what she deserves.\\n\\nWhen I started reading this I really thought it was going to be a carbon copy of Devotion, but the author did a great job changing the storyline. There always has to be drama and it was the perfect amount (as in not too much) and the ending was good (even though I would have liked an epilogue with them married and a pregnancy)! I know that would have been too scripted!\\n\\nGood job Ms. Hawthorne...and I like that you're putting Latinas on the scene!, Nathan and Amy were sweet.\\n\\nAt first I didn't feel the main characters had enough interaction to fall in love, but it was more about rediscovery. True love never dies and can overcome any obstacle., What can I say, who doesn't love a cowboy? Matt was the sweetest. I like that this novel was short and to the point, yet descriptive and full. I definitely appreciated there was no big drama. I wouldn't mind reading a sequel!, What I really liked about this story was that it was straightforward. The characters spoke to what they were feeling instead of the mind reading game. Also, if felt very real.  The only thing I could say I didn't like was that it was a bit predictable, but all in all great love story about true love prevailing!, Simply a love story....minimal drama. Really beautiful.\\n\\nI read this in one sitting. I couldn't put it down. It's a different twist on the shifter relationship and it felt genuine. Loved Renner and the fact that it didn't take Bethany forever to come around!, I love this Christian series! Great story line and ability to keep it fresh vice telling the same ole story but with different character names.\\n\\nIt was a quick romance, but believable. I enjoyed it!, How I felt about this book. It was obvious to me who the admirer was so I didn't like the attraction Bella expressed for the \"rival\". She just seemed really disloyal. Overall worth the read but don't expect to fall in love with the leading lady., Is for the steamy parts; however, the plot is rather ridiculous! I can appreciate a quick, world-wind romance, but under these circumstances I couldn't believe. Also, one description was \"dirty face\"....not appealing or sexy., Read this is two days. The author managed to keep it roughneck and sexy while changing the MC against MC storyline. I liked the new angle and can't wait to read the next one!, For a short novel this book managed to include some drama, romance, and suspense! I thoroughly enjoyed the male lead and of all the shifter books I've read this was a unique Claim., Nice story line and really sweet, but same formula as the others. I know these are Christian romances but they're all so perfect and neat!\\n\\nI can't wait to read Mac's story!\\n\\nBe forewarned...there are some errors!, This book was a good read, but at the same time felt kind of random and definitely felt unfinished. I liked how the characters met and some of the storylines that unfolded seemed to be rushed to their ending. I think this book is a stand alone but it needs a part two to feel complete., My favorite Donahue brother! This is a great series and I strongly recommend to anyone who just loves love! This really just makes you feel good...I loved it! A couple of errors with the writing, but still a great read!, I read Nail Down first and absolutely loved it so I gave this a go.  The wording and storyline are very similar to that book, but I still enjoyed reading this one. I will say it's a little sexier and has a little more drama, which makes it stand a part. And Nash is a damn sexy name!  Great read..., And fit well with the image of Ares!\\n\\nThis is another great novel from this author. I think she did a great job in telling the same story (bear finding and fighting for his mate) but making it different and still very interesting! Kat is a heroine you can root for and Ares is definitely a god....a big sexy one!, Outside of the shifter angle, I think this has been one of the \"realest\" books I've read! It wasn't perfect, perfect man, perfect woman and perfect sex....even the drama was real.\\n\\nDefinitely a surprised treat!, You know how its going to end at the beginning, but its still worth the read. I love books where the man falls for the entire family., Big strong bear is right...loved this book as much as the others! Again the author managed to tell a completely different story even though it was the same. I would say the only thing I didn't like was that Cassie was also a bear! I think it's something so sexy when it's a human female and a shifter, but definitely still worth the read! Nice spin that you may not be able to predict., Of the three McAllister brothers. I actually couldn't finish book 2, but I knew Maverick's would be funny and it didn't disappoint. I liked Maverick's wildness, boldness and dominance. I didn't necessarily care for Harmony too much. She played some games and I didn't think she was worthy of Maverick, but in the end I was glad how it worked out.\\n\\nRead if you're up for a funny (albeit a little ridiculous), steamy romance. It even has a little drama., No matter how many shifter novels I read I always love the idea of mating...it seems so eternal and much deeper than just love and marriage. Anyway...\\n\\nAstride was awesome. I like her sassy character and her strength. The reason she needed extra money could have been stronger, but it still brought her to Victor and he was just ALPHA personified. I loved \"my life, my everything\" (swoon).\\n\\nGood, quick read!, And this is the third such book that Ive read in the past few days and its my least favorite. I didn't even want to finish it. The male character was cool, but this girl in this book was so spoiled and entitled and just too snobby to like. In the other books I read the women showed strength and had been up against adversity. I could see why those strong men wanted those women, I just didn't feel it in this book., This is the standard paranormal shifter romance, but you have the bonus of reading two love stories in the one book (sorry if that's a spoiler). I also thought it was kind of funny! Maybe because it was fluid, but it still worked., Where the Heart is with Natalie Portman and I definitely don't regret it. It was good from beginning to end. I didn't want to put it down. The characters had real issues without it being overly dramatic...it was just a really good, sweet read! Loved Nick and Maddie!, This book is terrible...just terrible! It's so bad I wish I could not only give it no stars I wish I could take it out of print so no one else can lie and give it stars! It's absolutely ridiculous....almost like reading a cartoon...and not even a cartoon for older children that teens and adults can enjoy but a really childish cartoon! I couldn't even finish! Some parts I was like blah blah blah...then others my jaw dropped with the ridiculousness! Thank goodness this was on KU because it is NOT worth paying for!, Not quite sure what the genre is supposed to be. It says paranormal mnage romance, but that's basically the side story. The main story is more mystery suspense. There is actually two stories here. The paranormal romance story actually feels like it ends early on then the new mystery story begins. I guess it was ok, two good plots just weird how they were combined. Also, the writing implies that the events take place over a significant period of time, at least months, but also states that it's only been weeks. Just all around conflicting and again weird!, It's predictable, but still a sweet read! Lee is a dream, handsome, rich, bear shifter, little Clara is adorable and Patricia is a prefect addition to their little family. Sweet how it all comes together., This book is a quick read, but that doesn't lessen the steamy. Flynn...holy hotness! His desire is over the top, more like obsession and almost creepy, but somehow the author makes it sexy.\\n\\nI was kind of disappointed at the female being a virgin because that storyline gets old and of course the almost ten year age gap, but still I enjoyed this book very much. If only finding your soulmate really happened like that...., I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review...and honestly it was a great book and storyline. It was a little old fashioned with the arranged marriage thing, but I still found it interesting and worth the read. I will say I would have preferred an older female character and that the relationship between the three was more developed. It was 85% of bratty bride and then in the last bit her admitting her attraction and being in to the relationship. It was the right amount of steamy and drama!\\n\\nI have to admit....I don't know that I've read anything that made the Russian Mafia seem appealing!, It took me awhile to get into the prologue, but this was a great book and added a mystical element to the story. I thought some of Bailey's actions were dumb, but other than that I was glad there was no unnecessary fighting and doubts between the mates, just them being straight up with each other. Can't wait for Mason's and the Bears stories., And now with this book has just taken a turn for the worse.  Way too much going on. First shifters, then witches and now vampires....way too much! Also, it's like many eras or time periods in one. The witches from their era and the shifters from this era, so the language is disconnected and it seems like the author is trying to hard to make it work....the YouTube and quoting hip hop lyrics...not a fan at all., Crazy, fast-paced erotic novel.  Also, a little funny and intriguing.  You want to know what's up with the characters.  You also want to be a part of this kind of town.  Good read so far...., I can't believe I wasted my time reading this. There was no rhyme or reason to it and it really wasn't very erotic!\\n\\nThis is not really a book at all. I don't even think it can be classified as a short. It's more like an excerpt. Stories need a start, some texture and then an end.  The author has a long way to go., Good storyline...fluid! I liked the main characters as well as the supporting characters. Quick read and most everything gets resolved. I would have liked to see how the relationship between Rory and Blane turned out but maybe that is revealed later in the series.\\n\\nRory and Darra are worth a read..., So this was definitely the worst book of the series. I didn't like Rona at all. Her \"stubbornness\" just came across as bratty and annoying. I really was like why can't a heroine be killed (I know that's terrible). When she just had to go play with her birds during a time of war, essentially, and those two guards were killed I was like she should go as well! And for Daniel to be this strong, strategic mind or whatever, he did not have a backbone when it came to her. Keeping someone safe and trying to take away their freedom are two different things. And them even having time for this leisurely thing also didn't seem realistic or smart considering what was on the horizon and their proximity to the danger.\\n\\nAlso, the whole secrets angle was kind of blah. Her secret was just dumb. I'm surprised no one noticed these birds flying and always returning to the same place, but whatever. But for her to be upset that Daniel didn't share strategic plans with her...I just couldn't.\\n\\nI really didn't like her character so it took me really long to even finish the book, but I wanted to see how the end came for Raef., That's very surprising. I'd actually give it about a 2.25 or 2.5 for effort. I finished it, but it was painful.\\n\\nFirst I thought the book was repetitive in parts. I can't tell you how many times Shiloh said now is our real first time. I also thought Shiloh was childish. She actually acknowledged in the book how she was behaving in a juvenile, high school manner, but she persisted....stalking, jumping to conclusions, never being an adult. I almost felt this was a new adult romance because even though they were supposedly older they were written really young.\\n\\nThere was also no character development. It was 97% over before Gentry told Shiloh his real name. How can you claim to be in love with a person whose name you don't know. Not only did she not know his name she didn't know anything about him. Everyone else did, but no one told her and she kept trying to get info from them, but never asked \"the man she loved\" directly. Also, I couldn't tell you anything about Shiloh either except her name and her job.\\n\\nShiloh for some reason always had tears in her eyes? I didn't get it! Also, the insecurity wasn't attractive. Then her statement, the power of blonde hair, huh?\\n\\nEssentially through the entire book, Shiloh was an adoring groupie...she acted like a groupie and let him treat her like one.\\n\\nIn the end, the spanking scene was embarrassing...not erotic at all and actually seemed out of place with the novel. Really, the whole sensual massage and denying orgasm was just thrown in there. Then she goes from being scared she made a mistake by moving the telescope to learning his real name to getting proposed to....just ridiculous! Glad this was free, but sad I bothered!, Probably the worst shifter novel I've read, but it was still fairly entertaining and a quick read. It was actually a good storyline, I just had a few eye rolling moments....silver bullets and love being the most powerful magic. Those two things had me thinking of werewolf movies and Frozen., Loved Dylan and Matt. Good storyline, but some issues are left unresolved even though there is no indication of a second book. Good choice if you're looking for an erotic paranormal romance..., Quality note cards and fairly large. I love them. They arrived quickly and were packaged to ensure they stayed protected., Engraving was free and looks really good.  Arrived quickly and packed well., Very durable. I've washed it several times because my son still loves to wear it!  I would definitely recommend as a Halloween costume or for purchase if your child just likes to dress up., I thought it was a cute love story. It kind of reminded me of the book On Dublin Street. I love a story when the characters are met to be together., One of my favorite books.  I read it once or twice a year.  It is a classic romance., Because I saw an article in a magazine that said if I liked Fifty Shades, I'd like this trilogy.  Well, the magazine was wrong.  It's not that the book is awful, it just wasn't as good as Fifty Shades (not in content or fluidity).  It seemed to be a lot going on in the book, but with no conclusions (spoiler alert).  I really didn't care for Eva and all of her worrying, seemed unnecssary when Gideon was written to be the type of man that took care of business.  I also didn't care for the constant repeating how they were each other's soulmates and could just read each other without speaking words.  Not saying that those relationships don't exist it just seemed to be filler that wasn't really necessary.  I thought, ok I get it they were made for each other. I guess I can conclude my review by saying if you got through the first two books, you can get through this one, but I can't say you'll be satisfied with the ending or that you'd purchase a fourth book...., I thought this was a great love story, but also a great story about a woman recovering from and overcoming an abusive relationship.  As I read, I thought women really go through this type of abuse and it was good to read a story where the woman was able to break free and eventually live a god life.  I thought the movie should have stayed true to the book to show her strength and selflessness in the face of danger.\\n\\nI do think Julianne Hough was a good choice actress based on the character in the book and of course, you can never go wrong with Josh Duhamel., Authentic romance...\\n\\nCharacters are well developed and every storyline makes sense. Nothing is really over the top. The one thing I would have liked better is if Jocelyn was a little older. Braden is a true alpha male and just the thought of him made me want to take a trip!\\n\\nThis actually wasn't my first time reading this book, but it was still really good and kept my interest!, I won't rate all three novels because review will about sum it up.  I understand the Fifty Shades sparked a huge interest in the world of BDSM and that authors are going to try to capitalize on it, but come on can you have an original story line at least.  This book is a complete parallelism of Fifty Shades of Grey with different character names and slight variations.  Oh yeah, and the author throws in a male supposed best friend/protector that is way to free with personal information.  Well, I finished the series because I purchased it but there was really no need because I'd already read Fifty Shades., Sweet romance...who doesn't love a heroic firefighter. Megan was a little neurotic and Summer seemed too mature and cunning to be seven, but overall a good read...predictable, but still worth it., Funny, quick read and it was free! It being free set aside, I enjoyed Anna's journey to self realization and self worth., Fast, fun read and a cute romance.  Of course, it's predictable but a good read all the same.  If you're into novellas this would be a good story for you to read.  If you need more substance in your romances you probably want to choose something else., Where to begin...sometimes I like the secret baby angle, but in this one not so much. I couldn't get pass, maybe, chapter four. First, there are lots of typos. Second, I couldn't tell which era this book was supposed to set in. I hate books that are supposed to be set in modern times, but the dialogue (and judgement is from a different time). I understand having morals and values, but ruined at 23 for having a child out of wedlock, not so much. That brings me so my third issue with the book, is the heroine 23 and the hero 32, that puts him at 28 when she was 18, practically still a child! Definitely, never like that angle. I prefer mature adults in my romance novels. I didn't get to what actually happened in their initial interlude, but I bet she was a virgin...blah! Lastly, the mom is a snob, a hot mess snob. The two dads in the novel are the only characters that made me want to continue reading, but Im sure they're parts aren't big enough to make this novel worth reading., I couldn't wait to be done with this series! I don't think I've ever actually hated a female lead character but this supposed 26 yr old worked my nerves! She seemed more like a 15 yr old hormonal, psychotic or neurotic, petulant, bratty and spoiled girl! I'm not familiar with obsessive disorders, but I don't believe any grown man would deal that hypocritical and crazy behavior!\\n\\nThe first book was free so I gave it a try! I'm the type that has to finish a series! Anyway, book two was oversexed! It was like one line...sex scene! The entire relationship was physical and then next thing they're throwing around the \"L\"!\\n\\nI just really could have done without Alayna! Hudson kept me interested!, A really good read! Although it was predictable I still enjoyed the journey! Absolutely loved Ben! Peaked my interest in bearded men!, Loved Chase. Of course it was a predictable story, but I still enjoyed reading it. A good start to the Gamble Brother series., A rip off of Fifty Shades. Also, small little things like not knowing some medicines effect your birth control didn't seem realistic. And I also thought it was really repetitive., I read the first in the Blackstone Affair series rather quickly and was checking the Internet daily for the release of part 2...very disappointing.  It seemed rather redundant and I don't think she wrote from a man's perspective very well...., What can I say? There's just so much to love about Jake in this book. He's all alpha, but he's emotional and expressive. Tru is okay too. I hate her ups and downs and insecurities, but Jake makes it better and bearable.\\n\\nStill some grammatical issues, but definitely worth a read.\\n\\nLastly, I've read this book more than once and I'd recommend if you haven't seen Walk Line to check it out. Jake and Tru really are like Johnny Cash and Jun!, Predictable, but still a good read. Not overly obscene, but theres some heat if you need that in your romance novels.\\n\\nPart of a series, but can be read alone., I really couldn't pronounce the name Bronwyn so that sometimes messed up the flow of reading, but otherwise it was a great book about endurance and working through your problems...fighting for what you want., I understand that when you have a formula that works and your readers respond that you don't want to deviate from it, but really this book is exactly the same as Crazy For Her.\\n\\nWoman in trouble...ex-SEAL to the rescue.\\n\\nEx-SEAL wants girl, but feels he doesn't deserve!  He's resisting!\\n\\nMore mommy issues.\\n\\nOh no another kidnapping! By the way the kidnapping in Crazy For Her had a better storyline than this kidnapping!\\n\\nA rescue, some caveman stuff, an engagement!  Surprise, surprise!\\n\\nI liked Jake and Maria was ok, but I wish I didn't feel like I read the same exact book with slight changes!, Almost any book with hot Navy SEALS in it is a win, but I really liked the storyline and the relationship and chemistry between the characters.\\n\\nI don't know what else to say without giving up the book, but I'd definitely recommend this as a great romance and not lacking in the steamy!, This one was a sexy read. It was dark in some places! Nico was definitely all alpha male. The only thing I didn't like was that it was so much drama. It was like one thing after another and considering the drama started at the very beginning I don't even know how they stayed together. Also don't know about the love at first sight....more like lust at first sight.]</td>\n",
       "      <td>[I usually don't like to mix themes.  I feel like if it's a romance let it be a romance or if it's a suspense let it be a suspense; however this book had the perfect amount of suspense and romance. It was a really good book and not easily predictable (at least not all parts).  I would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys historical romance novels!, BBW romances I've read. This one had subsistence and wasn't just about sex. I liked the story line. It was cute and sweet unlike that some of the other short stories that are more raunchy although this one gets sexy as well., I think the best part of a book is when the chemistry is written so well that the characters become real and you are rooting for them to work out.  I loved this book and can't say that there were any surprises.  Not that is was exactly predicatable, but from the Prologue you know to expect something.\\n\\nThe characters Jakes and Nina were well written and I definitely fell in love.  Jake was strong, a little bit dangerous and passionate.  he loved hard, cared thoroughly and entirely dedicated to Nina.  I loved his depth and the fact that he was truly an alpha male.  Nina for me was somewhat the typical female lead, but I liked that she was so jaded, but was very receptive to Jake.  It was a beautiful story and really demonstrated to me how when you do find your true soul mate, love can really conquer all., Was definitely a man you could easily fall in love with, but in my opinion Avery definitely didn't deserve him. Well written, good story and supporting cast, but it kind of dragged out in parts. Predictable in parts, but worth reading., With a powerful message and beautiful love story. I read this one before book 1, but it's kind of a spoiler if you do it in that order!\\n\\nLuke, Kayla and Eli....love them!, And although there were a lot of similarities to the other books, this was still a good and unique read.\\n\\nCan't wait for Micah and Tessa...., Even though I'm not really into the \"can't stand each other at first\" romance where there's so much hostility you're like where did you have time to fall in love, this was a pretty good read. I thought book one was overly dramatic, just one thing after another, but this one was a little less. Definitely recommend!, Caleb and Mira's story was written beautiful even though it was slightly dark.\\n\\nI really enjoy how this author writes shifter stories and the connection. Also, I love that she has heroines that you can love. They tend to be strong and admirable.\\n\\nNot overly sexual just a great story...., I read this is basically one sitting. I loved Dragon and Nic's story and can't wait to read how everything unfolds.\\n\\nThis book is super hot and sexy...., I just couldn't put this book down.  This author writes women awesomely. Farrah....you just wanted her win! And Aanon is definitely a man I would mind being on a secluded homestead with. There isn't one thing to not love about this book, strong heroine, sexy man and a great love story!, This is a dark, but powerful story. I love that the author addressed two issues that typical affect women, but had them happen to a man (because they do happen to men as well). It's very emotional and raw. Even when the author is telling a similar story to the first in the series (the save the girl story) she manages to tell it differently, making it new and fresh.  The entire story pulls you in!\\n\\nI think my only issue with the book is that the main female character is so young and the main male character has known her practically all of her life. It just felt like he had a thing for her even when she was really young.  Carrie was a trooper though and stronger than any 20 yr old I know, but Nicole still rocks!, But it's getting weaker as it progresses. So far all the club trouble has been because of these women? Not only that in this book, so much was predictable and so much made me roll my eyes and want to stop reading. All the secrets and who couldn't predict the Dragon situation (don't want to spoil it for those that don't see that coming). I really liked Nicole in part one when she had sense enough to remove the memory card from the phone and when she took the two bullets for Dragon, but in this novel she did just seem dumb, self-centered and just a little annoying.\\n\\nThe bad azz bikers are definitely getting softer but their mouths are still filthy!  Afraid reading this one I would have liked a story about Bull and not Dani and Crusher. It seem they told enough of their story in this book!, Such dirty, filthy talk could be such a turn on?\\n\\nThis book is so steamy and so rough. I couldn't get enough of Roman. If you like alpha males, you'll enjoy this book!\\n\\nAs far as the rest of the storyline, the author created an interesting plot. It's not all sex, there's substance here.\\n\\nGreat, HOT read!, Shifters and MCs....loved the storyline of this book! It's short, sweet and a nice like romance. And I agree, mate is just so much more than a husband or a wife!\\n\\nFlow of this book is great...can't wait to read Ares' story!, I started with Elias and River and that was really like most romantic comedies that I've seen.\\n\\nThen there was Silas and Tempest...not my favorite, but still okay. You may need to read it to understand some parts in Luke's story!\\n\\nLuke, Luke, Luke....what can I say besides I want one! He was awesome, so alpha (oozed sex appeal), funny and mature way beyond 24! Definitely the best read of the three.\\n\\nThe Saint Brothers are definitely worthy of a little praise!, I don't understand how you fall in love with someone who doesn't speak. The heroine of the story does come off as \"dull\". You understand why she's hesitant, but at some point they should have exchanged a meaningful conversation.\\n\\nNot that great....also felt the author could have used a few different descriptive words..., Beaston's story is the best by far in this series. He touches your heart and you're rooting for him! Of course you still have crazy Willa, who makes everyone of these books hilarious, but even without her this story is strong and with the read., Creed was definitely a sexy alpha...but I think what makes this book are the side characters.  The crew is a riot...especially Willa and I love Easton. I can't wait to read his story.\\n\\nWhat you'll get from this story...a true meaning of friendship!, Laugh out loud funny! Willa is a spitfire as some would say. She's intelligent, strong and really draws you in. Matt was awesome and they made a likable pair!, But I do like that there is (spoiler alert) no woman kidnapping and an amazing rescue! I'd give is 3.5 stars.\\n\\nThroughout I think that Charlie's and Eva's navet would have been more believable or less maddening if they came from a small town and not a city. I mean who doesn't know the danger of cartels? Also, I'm always glad when the heroine isn't the maturest 22 or 23 yr old that you'll ever meet but an older woman (in this case Eva was 26), but I was disappointed that she seemed the youngest and most clueless. I was also disappointed when she sprouted off Shakespeare at Will during a fight. That just seemed weird in a MC novel and during a fight against cartel members, well in any fight really!\\n\\nI did like that Will's character challenged the image of the normal biker. Most ppl think people in MCs are uneducated or minimally educated thugs and this gave you a different image. Will's character was struggling and it was good to see him come out okay on the other side even if the storyline was just so-so. I would think that two years is a rather long time for a club to let someone be rogue, but that's just another thing in the storyline I didn't like., I received an advanced review copy in exchange for an honest review...\\n\\nThis is the first MC novel I read where it didn't seem like the club lived the life. Other novels make it seem like the MC lifestyle was grand and legit so I appreciated what in my mind is a truer depiction of what goes on with one percenters. I could even buy into the sex trafficking storyline.\\n\\nAs for Skin and Meg, they were hot. I loved Skin's dirty, filthy mouth. The relationship aspect of the novel falls in line with other MC novels but still worth the read., Some commented that this story was too long and that Luke was a jerk...granted he was an azz but he was struggling and I still lived his character! Harper was a great heroine and you really rooted for her and wanted her to be happy. There were so many stories (lives) wrapped up in this book but they were all perfect together and never too much. You really needed every bit that was in the novel and it made it a great story! Every character was awesome!, That I've read that actually incorporated the true nature of bears. I loved that and the fact that everyone wasn't perfectly beautiful or rich. Really good story, well written and I enjoyed the character of both the hero and heroine., I definitely love that the women in this series aren't fragile, needy or easily manipulated. And I love how the men love them.\\n\\nJenner and Lena had a great story, but I also enjoyed the side characters. Easy read..., Reading MC romances because they started to sound the same with the dirty sex talk and story, but this was a great story to come back to. It managed to be sexy without being dirty (he wasn't calling the girl his good little slut or anything crazy like that) and also the male lead managed to come off as a good guy even though he was a killer.  Also, that cover art was perfect for the man in the book. Sexy mutha! There really wasn't anything I didn't like about the story!, More of an epilogue almost! I'm giving it four stars because even a twenty page book about that sexy rocker Jake Wethers is worth reading....\\n\\nThe end is sad....I almost cried!, Sally? Where does the author get these names? The men have sexy as sin names...given and taken while the women have really unappealing names. Also, how is everyone one of these chicks a virgin? Initially, I almost stopped reading because I was like oh no not another barely legal virgin, but I received an ARC so I gave it a go. The story was ok. I wasn't feeling the arranged marriage thing. It just didn't make since considering the same non-information could have been obtained if the Mother charter would have just embedded one of their own in the club. Also, there were a lot of speeches and kind of repetitive in parts. I kind of found myself wanting it to be over. What did work for me was Asphalt. I love a bad boy. He talked dirty and was all alpha male. Also, the cover art was beautiful. I gave it four stars because I actually really like the bonus book about Blackjack. I thought his story was fairly awesome without being too drawn out or over the top.\\n\\nGood classification as erotica...I guess then the story can just be blah as long as it delivers in other ways.  It's worth the read.\\n\\nI received an ARC in exchange for an honest review!, I thought this was the sweetest, most romantic book! There was no drawn out drama, just a budding relationship. The characters were all developed and there was the perfect amount of back story. Definitely not raunchy but there is some steam!  Really I wanted there to be more to read.\\n\\nExcellent, excellent, excellent!, Cage, a sexy bear shifter, returns home to protect and claim his fated mate, Carrier. There's some obstacles, some drama, some sexy romance and of course the HEA. Worth the read..., I absolutely loved Sam and it was a great story; however, Chloe was annoying. I love a good \"damsel in distress\" story, but the woman can still be strong and sensible. Chloe was just young, dumb and naive....not a good combination and just had me like really every time she did something. Sam and the plot make it worth reading though..., Maybe more aptly titled, but maybe not as sexy. Let's see...the book could use better editing. Throughout the novels the author referred to Cami as Madison and that sometimes breaks up the flow of the reading. Also the transition from book one to book two wasn't fluid. It was almost as if she took a long break I between reading the two and should have gone back for a refresher to get recapped events correct. Again that interrupts the flow of the novel. As for as the context..book gets you interested. Book two keeps you interested in Drew but made me like Cami less. She got a little annoying, but maybe that is because as a reader we knew what Drew was going through and his thoughts than he hadn't shared with her, but BOOK THREE...OMG! I couldn't love Drew anymore! Book three was the perfect romance! The right about of steamy and who doesn't love a sexy many, definitely an alpha, and can cook! I'd definitely recommend this series if only to get to book three alone!, And that's only because I've liked some of Nicole's books in the past but this one just wasn't my cup of tea. It's similarly themed as far as older man falling for younger (22 years old virgin) woman. Firefly was just too crude, like over the top crude and there wasn't anything I liked about Cora.  I also didn't care for the return of Meg and her new role in the club., So I was very surprised to find that this is a series. It took me forever to read and I thought it was rather repetitive. A lot could have been cut out to speed things along. I also wasn't surprised by half of what was revealed until the very last chapter. I will have to continue to read because I need to know how it ends, but I won't be happy about it., Emotional, funny, well written...just great all around. It was the perfect ending to the series! I won't say more because I just want to give all the great parts away...all I can say is READ IT!\\n\\nYOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT;-), I loved everything about Mason...his dominance, loving, caring and acceptance. And he had a fresh story. He was a real beast boar. Beck was actually the first female in the series I didn't particularly care for. She was rather deceitful, which led to her predicament.\\n\\nAs always love that the supporting characters!, I wouldn't mind being loved by mature Silverback Kirk. I loved reading Kirk and Ally love story as well as back stories. They both seem to be broken from their past but find a place, peace and love with each other.\\n\\nI also like how the stories tie together with the Grayback and Firebear series.  Even though these are all standalone stories, you may not understand the return of IESA if you haven't read Firebears. I'm definitely looking forward to Mason's and Clinton's stories and hopefully an end to IESA.\\n\\nAnd for those that want sexy...this is sexy from start to finish. A definite good choice to read..., I'm glad Link got his happy ending and there are lots of happy surprises in this book!\\n\\nVera and the Dawson's provide some comic relief, but really it's Link's strength and alpha maleness that made me love this book. From the beginning he was just all man and straightforward!\\n\\nGreat read!, Some reviews don't like the hibernation angle but with so many shifter romances out there, that's what makes this one stand out.\\n\\nAs for Tobias...I loved him and how he was transformed by love...well at least less growly. Vera was another heroine I could get behind. She was super funny and kept the book interesting (she kind of reminded me of Willa from the Grayback series...if you haven't read, I definitely recommend).\\n\\nI guess I would say the only baby thing about this book was I vaguely remember a baby being mentioned in Jenner's book but there was no mention of one in this book and also the living seems a little rustic to be 2015, but if you imagine the story set in a different era you'll love everything.\\n\\nI'm ecstatic to read Link's story and I am sure based on the three released to date that I won't be disappointed!, But I couldn't finish it. I did at least get a little beyond 50%, but that took weeks so I gave up. I'm fairly sure I'm done with the series. I don't understand the appeal of the foul-mouth, treat me like shyt, but you're it for me storyline. I also don't care for the virgin, young girl with the older badass biker guy. I don't know, I just didn't find anything redeeming about this book...and the editing was terrible.\\n\\nI received an ARC in exchange for an honest review., Dalton was a sexy beast and Kate was the perfect mate. I loved the banter and this plot twist, or \"the drama\", was really intriguing and fresh. I was kind of disappointed that Clayton turned out to still be a jerk...I guess that means no sweet novella for him. Can't wait to read Chance!!!!, And I thought this was a great way to close it out. Chance was definitely a sexy wolf and the heroine was pretty awesome even though she was an assassin so to speak.\\n\\nVery funny and a nice little romance!, And different from other paranormal romances. I liked that it wasn't too drama filled. It was the right amount of back story, suspense and the perfect ending.  Also, who wouldn't fall for a man that can cook!, But I didn't like this one as much as the first. I guess (spoiler alert) there is something more appealing about the shifter-human relationship than the shifter-shifter relationship, so I don't like the idea that they can \"change\" humans. Also, I'm not sure how I feel about them IEAS and going public storyline, but I guess you need some adversity.\\n\\nAs for the characters, it was the opposites attract kind of attraction. They were written well but I don't know that I actually felt it., This was definitely the steamiest out of the Fire Bears Series...I also laughed out loud for parts of the story. It was emotional and I think a little more than just a shifter romance novel...hopeful maybe (in a metaphoric way).\\n\\nThe only thing that I don't like about this series if that the humans don't stay human...but the love and the bond is awesome!, Couldn't put it down. I like that it was short and not dragged out.\\n\\nThe Breck Crew were honorable. I liked that aspect of the novel. I also loved Cody, his strength and not letting past hurts prevent him from loving Rory. I also loved that Rory was strong and didn't cower when things got tough.\\n\\nGood read!, But fast-paced. I think the entire book took place within three weeks.\\n\\nI liked the finding love again angle and the idea of when you know just knowing and going with it, but I still thought it could be a little more building of the relationships.\\n\\nI also would have liked an epilogue., Sexier than they read...lol! The dialogue was a slight turn off, because I couldn't imagine the words\"ye\" or \"yer\" coming across as sexy. Outside of that it was an okay read. I liked the bucket list angle, but there was a little too much drama with all the jumping to conclusions and no one just having an adult conversation. I'm guessing characters were you adults...be advised if you like maturer characters, dialogue and situations.\\n\\n3 and 1/2 stars!!!, A long read. I didn't feel the chemistry and the back and forth bickering was more annoying that endearing. Maybe there could have been a couple more chapters where an actual relationship or feelings developed. But it's a sweet, western romance and I love those...so I'd recommend!, I don't think I realized what a new adult romance was until I read this.  Rather young, would not recommend for adult readers looking for a good romance novel.  It really is written for young adults...anywhere from ages 18-22.  Immature a bit., It's actually the same story line as the first six books.  I don't know why I keep buying them....mostly because I started the series so I have to finish it, but I'm also hoping one will become it's own book.  You have the same group embrace, engagement, someone gets married, someone else gets married, and a pregnancy is announced.  The only new twist to this book was they threw in a gay couple to try and shake things up.  I will say it's not awful, but it's a long read because you feel like you've read it before.  Very predictable!, Good story line and flow. The drama was real and not overly dramatic. Of course, Zach was amazing from start to finish, Presley not so much.\\n\\nGood read if you like second chance romances., I liked this second addition to the Gamble Brother series a little better than the first because it was a love story developing and I enjoyed their journey. I also could appreciate that the lead female was not depicted as the norm, but rather eclectic and her own person., I'd give it 3.5 stars! It's steamy and hot and a fairly decent romance. I loved BJ and how he loved Layla, but I guess I would have liked a more dramatic ending.\\n\\nI can't say mush more without giving it away, but I'd say if you like filthy language and reformed bad boys give it a read., Good book! Fast read! I don't think I read in the description that it was also a suspense so that was a nice surprise....as well as whodunit;-), Who wouldn't love a good looking doctor? I liked the old time feel of the book and values even though it was set in modern times. I liked that it made me laugh out loud as well as make me dreamy. The only thing I didn't like was the strong friendship angle and the lack of honest communication, seemed conflicting., So much so I read it in one day! Let me get the dislikes out of the way really quickly...Stevie gave her son too much power over her decisions and thats about it! I loved everything else about this book. I loved that Stevie was the usual long haired (blonde or red headed), blue or green eyed dream...I loved that Ethan struggled with a real issue...all the supporting characters were relevant. Just a great book all around, so good!, I really didn't want to put this book down and it's perfect to read heading into the holiday season. If you're a Hallmark movie kind of person, this book is definitely for you!, And as they go this was a fairly decent one, I just wish it was more about the main characters. I am guessing because this is the first in a series, the supporting cast had to be strong and interesting, but I don't think anything significant happened between Zoe and Roland until I was 50% into the book. But the supporting characters really kept me going and I am most looking forward to Leos story., It may be unfair to write a review when I didn't finish the book, but I couldn't. From the beginning, I had reservations. The first was came when Rex man-handled and acted like a jerk toward Tabby and he response was to be turned on. That's a no for me. I don't get the books where there is this antagonistic relationship or rudeness on the part of the male and the female just has no control over herself and is attracted to a jerk essential. I've never experienced it and so it always makes me roll my eyes. Second, Tabby from the beginning seemed to over familiarize herself with Rex and his kids. Have you ever been to a hotel or lodge where food gets delivered and the person starts to ask personal questions or had a hotel employee let themselves into your room and sit on your bed and start a conversation with your children? Yeah me either so another eye roll. Also, when reading this book and discovering Rex has a secret you wouldn't believe that he went into the shower and left his room door opened for someone to enter anyway, but that's whatever. Lastly, when Rex refers to another of the hotel employees as \"the fat old woman\", I was done. Tabby is only attracted to him for superficial reasons, which didn't keep me interested in the book. Had he had one good quality or a better attitude, maybe I would have gotten further, but I couldn't. Sorry Nicole!, If I didn't have to read Jamie and Chase's story.  I liked how the author addressed some of the issues that pregnant women face, but mostly I just liked reading about a loving couple.  Throughout the series I didn't see the relevance of Anna being a \"big girl\", but over all the series was smart, funny, even if poorly edited.\\n\\nOverall series gets a four and a half from me...only rated this last book so low because of the inclusion of Chase and Jamie's story.  Worth a read and books 1-4 were free!, Some complained about how easily Nina submitted to the love triangle, but she's a woman with needs and desires and though she didn't intend to \"put out on the first date\" things happen and to me it didn't make her seem weaker than she asserted, just more in tuned to her body and going after what she wanted!\\n\\nIf I had to be a part of a mnage I'd definitely want Aeden and Soren in the mix with me. So willing to please and both alphas to boot! Sexy all around...\\n\\nWriting is appropriate to the storyline, but maybe I would have liked an epilogue to see that they stayed happy and that she made got preggers or had some cubs!, Axel was sexy...and who doesn't love authoritative and dominant men. Emma was a pretty smart heroine. I thought that maybe she was a little quick to forgive Axel and at times a little needy, but otherwise she made smart moves. The storyline was solid. I was glad to see the Tsepov drama come to a head and the author introduced a ton of sexy, alpha men who's book I'm looking forward to, but enjoyed coming across in The Temptation Trap. I will say it was a little long and in some parts repetitive, but still a good story over all. I don't know that I trust the author's BBW classification, but otherwise a definite recommend.\\n\\nI received an ARC in exchange for an honest review., I never understand why the women in bodies have to be such headaches, but its probably because were emotional and unstable creatures. That aside Shannons behavior was understandable even if it made me want to just punch her at times. She really redeemed herself in the end. Greg, like every hero, was swoon worthy. I loved him from beginning to end.\\n\\nI would have liked something added at the end about Gregs foundation even though you can figure out what happened with it.\\n\\nDefinitely recommend!, Keisha was likable and Conner seemed lickable;) This book has a little bit of drama, romance and even touches on domestic violence a little (message: its not always physical...if its toxic, get out). Anyway, enjoyed!, Great plot and execution by the author. There wasn't a bunch of unnecessary storyline. This was a little different from other shifter stories in that they weren't a secret species which I liked. Connor seemed sexy as all get out...and Cassie was a heroine you could get behind!, Because Dutch is a sexy beast!\\n\\nWhat I didn't like was the woman was also a shifter. I kind of like the shifter-human mate dynamic. Plus she was almost as bad azz as the guys in the book. I also didn't like it was yet another woman in hiding and trying to hide a child.\\n\\nOther than those few things the book was a good read. There is a continuous theme in all the books so I  am guessing in the last book is where it all comes to a head. Looking forward to it.\\n\\nStrong heroine...conflict different from the first two in series but it all still makes sense and is relevant., Even though it was similar to the others with the hidden pregnancy. You would actually think that these guys can sense they knocked up the girl or at least had an inkling considered it happened to everyone other squad person but ok! The Arctics storyline continued but was different and really interesting. You can tell it's not done but we'll see which characters the author comes up with to finish that aspect.\\n\\nKelis was bad azz without being so dominant that I didn't like her character. And who wouldn't want to have two sexy men after them.\\n\\nDefinitely worth the read but bare with the errors!, Because I didn't like someone getting hurt for this story to work, but it worked some beautifully. I like that even though theres drama its not over the top, but still impactful. I even almost cried at one part of the story.\\n\\nReally good read..., And because Kayson was so fantastically written Im giving this book four stars. I didn't care for Ariel at all. Ive never been a girl who gets making the next man pay for the sins of the last so that storyline always makes me roll my eyes. She was just too insecure and all over the place. The danger storyline was predictable and a little weirdly executed, but the Iron Orchids shenanigans make it bearable., But a good read. A little erotic, but the story has merit. Rose is a little annoying, but she's also young and finds clarity. There was a perfect amount of drama and suspenses...nothing's drawn out.\\n\\nNice little blend of western romance and a little kink..., I definitely love Gabe and Elle is ok. I cant really tell how old she is or in what era this book is supposed to be set in. Elle seems very sheltered and to not have very much life experience. She does come across as kind of high maintenance and judgmental, but thats where the opposites attract thing comes into play, because Gabe is the complete opposite...down-to-earth and a real, relatable character.\\n\\nIts kind of a quick fall, so I recommend this book for ppl who like the world-wind kind of romance., I was really excited about the description and for the most part it was ok, but I'm not sure I like how this author writes black women. I also thought some of the \"dramatic\" events were too rushed...it was like they were added for effect or impact, but they were also resolved so quickly that I was like did something just happened. She could have actually left it out considering how little it impacted the story.\\n\\nAnyway, like I said it was ok...predictable of course...some spelling errors and missing words, but it doesn't mess with the flow too terribly., I usually don't read books with characters that are so young, but I was glad the author kept the story age appropriate. I loved all of the characters especially Liam, Sebastian and Charlie.\\n\\nStory is pretty predictable, but still a good read. If youve every watched the movie Return to Me, youll love this book., I loved Lincoln throughout all three books. Kali was a little annoying at times with her attitude, but still loved her as well. All of the characters and storylines were well developed and delivered. I experienced a range of emotions which is a good thing, a great thing! I wouldnt mind a surprise fourth book...PLEASE!, I didn't want to put it down. I actually didn't realize it was a trilogy and before I even finished the first one I was looking for the second and third.\\n\\nThe storyline is real, the character are real, the emotion is real...I almost cried a couple of times. Absolutely can't wait to read what's next for Lincoln and Kali., So I decided to read this book because of the one and two star ratings. I thought they were funny and had my interest piqued. I didn't like Eadyth. I did think she was smart and strong, but she didn't come across as torn between two loves, but more just kind of skanky (did they use the term wanton back then)\\nand wanting to have several lovers. I actually thought the brothers deserved better, especially Hjalmar. It seemed to me that he only settled for the sharing idea because he really wanted her. I would have to do like period research to see if that kind of thing was even a thing (lol)her keeping both of them as lovers and having both of their children. I was like huh. Its one thing to get your threesome on, but that was going a tad bit over-the-top. But its a somewhat steamy read and the story itself isn't bad, but the relationship between the three was just weird.]</td>\n",

They cover my arms almost to the elbows and they are very comfortable. They sent them to me very quickly and I am very satisfied with the product., The image was perfect, Arena di Verona was magnificient.  I was disappointed when I heard the singers.  Not good at all. There are subtitles, this was not the problem.  As we say in French, \"tant pis\".  Martin, Susana's husband., The sound is really awful.  I like the singers though.  The sound...it sounds as an old 78.  If you are deaf...buy this.  But put the subtitles!  Martin, I loved the singers, the mise en scene is weird though.  I would recommend this Carmen.  A beautiful version.  Martin, Susana's hubby., I didn't expect so beautiful versions.  I love these concertos and the pianos are vibrant.  Thank you very much for the good music.  Martin, Just the very best version I have.  I have 3 other versions, borenboim, mehta, furtwangler... I don't know about the other versions...but I love this one and I also have the libretto, the singers are the very best.  Martin, I bought this title because I liked the singers... Rodion Schedrin is not a very talented composer, he owns his fame to his wife, the great dancer, Maya Plisetskaya... He was very well positioned in the Communist party... But except his Carmen ballet from Bizet opera... You can't ask too much.  He is a mediocre composer.  And this is not an exception.  He is modern, but not too much, nothing teally new.  Of course, this is my humble opinion...\\n\\nMartin, Very good, but 4 CDs for just overtures, a little too much.  I bought his complete operas, then I had 3 CDs with syphonic music for the price of 7 CDs.  When I bought this I didn't know that.  After buying 13 operas, 5 weren't completed, I just lostened of three of them.  Of course, if you don't like opera, it is a deal.  But, in my humble opinion, if you don't like opera don't approach Siegfried, he is mainly an opera composer. Martin Pitchon, not Susana., Yes, this is an early work conversely her first book.  It's a romance and a mystery very well written.  I liked it very much and when I was in the last 3rd of the book it was really difficult to leave it.  I had to stay up till 4AM to finish it!\\nIf you are going on vacation or have some days off it will be the perfect time to read it!, I liked the story even if is not very original and a bit slow moving. Why? Because the interaction between the characters is true and interesting. It is a sweet story, not realistic but poignant nonetheless., A new writer for me, Ms arnold delivers a nice classic romance.  It doesn't have surprises in it's plot but the story reads smoothly and has a sweet love story in it.  Myabe is not accurate in terms of court strategy, as some of the reviewers say, but it was most agreable to read., I downloaded this book for free and I was glad for it to be so.\\nThe plot and the 5 stars reviews pushed me to downloaded and read it immediately even if I have 600+ books to read and I was hoping for more from this book.  It is not bad but it lacks something.\\nFirst, some parts drag for a long time and there is nothing coming out of it (and I should tell you that I like my books long, the longer the better when they have something interesting to tell) then the dialogues were a bit out there, seeming forced.\\nThe story is not bad, maybe with a good editor it could even be a very good book.  What I liked it was that the H/h didn't fall for each other the first minute they saw each other, it was a bit at a time and the portrayal of the Shetlands was very accurate and nice., I liked it but I think that a professional editor could have improved some parts of the book. The story line has some inconsistencies and some parts that are not explained but all in all it is a good story. It is a bit strange that the heroine can fall in love with this cruel man but it is a fantasy romance so... it could happen., I enjoyed the story very much. It makes a fun and easy reading when you have a short time to read but it is satisfying. A little treasure. I usually like my romances longer but this one doesn't disappoint., I don't even know where to begin.  The story wasn't awful but the usual romance.  h is in love since forever with the H and he was always trying to avoid her (they were children at the time) then she returns home and she is beautiful and accomplished and he is in lust with her but he doesn't want a serious relationship because of the dangers of his work.  But if it was told in an interesting form it could be good.  The situations are ridiculous and forced and the dialogues poor and so not interesting.  I finished it but it was really hard work. At least it was short., I've read these books a long time ago and I don't remember the details but they stayed with me all this time.  They are on my list of favourite books of all time.  What I remember is:  great adventure, lovable characters and strong plot.  It is definitely a must read., A great page-turner. If you have to take a long flight this would be the ideal book to take with you. It's the first book I've read of this author and I loved it. I will be reading more for sure. The situations were well created and evolved naturally in the environment of the plot. I recommend this book for the adventure loversand there is a bit of romance too., Jezebel's blues is a beautiful love story.  It has a tortured hero, a disillusioned heroine and a catastrophe that leaved them stranded and alone for two days.  The story is touching, sexy, romantic.  I will recommend this book to my friends., I bought this book because I love to read new spins on a fairy tale and the reviews of this book spoke of that.  The spin is new and original and I liked the characters.  They are interesting, well rounded and have the potential to be funny.  Most of the reviews say that the book is funny.  It is true that it has some funny scenes but for me the humour in these scenes seemed a bit forced.  There are some nice passionate scenes and all in all the book was nice to read and I would recommend it if you like fairy tales., This is a nice book to read and relax.  A story whith love, adventure and a bit of history.  It is not Gone with the Wind but it is a good story.  The characters are engaging and you will have a nice time with them.  If you like books with romance but with more substance then you will like this one.\\nThe story begins in England where Nicholas is betrayed by his stepmother out of his inheritance so he embarks to America to search for a new life and his fortune.  He will stay in the South in the years just before the Civil War.  There he will build a beautiful and grand plantation and meet Mandy.\\nYou have the H/h relationship since Mandy was a child, an engaging and willful child, and some interesting supporting characters that give the book his flavour., I am almost finished with book three of this series and I've already bought the next one, volume two which contains books four, five and six. I love the books and the characters are great.  They are so well constructed. Captain Lacey is an imperfect character that lends reality to the novel and the secondary characters are all very interesting too, like Grenville or the mysterious Mr. Denis. Love them all. Now I have less time to read but these books are really interesting and I bring them with me to work so I can read during my lunch time. So if you like mysteries do yourself a favor and begin reading the first book., As I said on the review of the other books of this series I loved these books, I had the first one for free and I couldn't stop there. If you are going away on vacation this is a perfect book to take on the beach., Liked this book a lot. It seemed liked a blend of Buffy the vampire slayer and the fever series. The characters are alive. Michel is the dark hero, we don't know if he is good or hides so ething very dark. There is adventure all along not a minute of respite. Now I bought the next book and I am going to read it just now. Can't wait!, I've read all of the series and loved it. The first book was a frebie by Amazon and after reading it I couldn't stop there. This author was new to me but now i am going to read all her books. Her charscters are lovable and real and I love what she have done with this other world., It is a nice story, a story of hope and the rhythm is also interesting.  I liked the characters also even if at times they sounded too perfect but as I said the story was nice and sweet.  But, and this is a big but, the narrator clubbed me with a big hammer on the head about alcoholism.  Yes, I know that alcoholism is a very big problem and yes I know that it can destroy a person, a family but I don't need to be hammered with it every two pages on the book.  I think, on the positive side, that this book could be rescued and be edited and be a very nice book to read., I had the first book of this series for free and I bought all the subsequent books because I was hooked on the storyline. The characters are engaging and true. It's been some time since I 've read this so I don't remember details but what I remember is that I liked it and that I am waiting for. Ore books on this series., I've read these books a long time ago when they first appeared on paper so i can't really review them because I don't remember the details but what I remember is that I loved them. They were the first I read of Ms. Canham and they hooked me. After that I bought every Marsha Canham's book., When I read this series some months ago I fell in love with the writing. I didn't know Ms. Thacker but now she is in my list of writers to follow. Her characters are real people with flaws and very endearing. When I read the first book I didn't know what to expect so it was a very nice surprise and I loved it. The first and third books have a touch of the fantastic. So if you like the fantastic, time travel and sweet romance, you will love these three books., Weak. Not great.  Dev is cool, but so many books so similar becomes a bit boring, I liked this book very much. I recommend it if you like heartwarming romances. It kept me entertained in a beautiful summer day. Read it!, I had this story as a freebie and thus I feel bad to give a bad review but I couldn't even finish it.  It was boring and I was always hoping that things would change and that the characters would begin acting like people and not like characters in a story.  Sorry but for me it wasn't worthy of my time.  I give it 2 stars because at least there wasn't grammar mistakes like in other freebies., It surprised me! I had this book for free and I wasn't sure what I was going to get. But it was a very nice reading., This is a nice reading, well written but do not think it is realistic. I liked it very much as an escapist reading. I had a very nice moment with this book. So if you like romance, I think you will like it. It has all the ingredients. Beautiful heroine, gorgeous and succesful heroe, problems falling all over them, the heroine has had a difficult time when she was a child. And what I liked the most, the hero is very sweet., Maybe that's the problem, that I haven't read the same book. I can't understand the 4 and 5 star reviews. First, why make it about angels when all the attitudes and the surroundings and the way of \"life\" was so earthly? In another environment this could have been more credible. The dialogues seem written by a high school student. Here is an example:\\n\"He's blocked you. I'll try\"\\nA moment later Nitro spoke again. \"He's blocked me too, and Celeste has tried too, it's a total block\"\\n\\nI don't want to be cruel but this story needs a lot of work before being ready for publishing., A fun book to read and the story of the angels is worked differently from the ones I've read till now. I loved to read the two stories developed here and I want to read the next book. Searching for it after writing this. I recommend this book, Usually I don't read billionaire romances because again, usually, I find them an easy way for authors to iron difficult situations with easy money. But here this novel? I absolutely loved it! I bought it only because it was a Miriam Minger without knowing that I was going to be fascinated by the book and the characters. Hannah and Cain are great characters that stay true to themselves throughout the book. It is a STEAMY romance and a delightful one! READ IT!, I didn't know the writer and the book was free so my expectations weren't great but what a wonderful surprise I had!  This is a romance but the heroine is not exactly like so many that you find in other books. She is fierce and sometimes acts impulsively but the difference here is that she thinks in a way way ahead of her time. Not to do stupid things but things that are really important to her as a person, to grow as a person. The storyline is great and I loved the way it is told. So I think it is a great book worth reading and keeping., There is someone here that says that SEP writes always the same storyline and she is right!  But I continue to buy them because she writes so well!  I love her writing even if the storyline is repeated but in this book the hero, Ted, is not very likeable and the chemistry between H/h is not working for me.  The sex is a bit off, is it me?\\nBut the book is very likeable, a very nice book to read on the beach (I am dreaming of beaches) or if you have a nice weekend to read., I almost didn't buy this book after all the bad reviews I read.  Someone said that we could skip this book and go right to the third one \"Bonnie\" but finally I decided to buy  it and make my own opinion about it and I am really happy that I did it.  I loved it.  Yes, maybe there isn't a lot of new things happening in the first half of the book but as I read the first books on this saga a long time ago it refreshed my memory about Joe's and Eve's relashionship and the last third of the book was really a roller coaster and the end a big cliffhanger.\\nYes, I know that Ms Johansen has been leading us with this story a long time but \"Eve\" and \"Quinn\" are very good stories preparing us, I hope, for the final end (excuse the redundance). So, if you liked the other books I can't see why you wouldn't like these.  I even liked them more than some of the precedent books in this saga., I feel mixed about this book.  On the one hand I liked it, the rhythm, the way it develops and evidently the characters.  I've been reading about Eve and Quinn since the beginning and as much as I liked them I wanted this to end.  As all the other readers of Ms Johansen I wanted to know what happened to Bonnie and for Eve to found her and bring her home but, and this is a personal but, I don't know if I liked the way the author found to resolve the mystery of Bonnie.\\nAlong the way we had so much angst that this felt like an anticlimax but on the other hand I felt relieved.  Maybe that is the way it should be.  I can relate to that.\\nSo if you are like me that followed all the series I imagine you want to read this book to know how it ends.  I think it's worth it and as I said on the reviews of the last two (Eve and Quinn) even if the book sometimes goes back it is nice to remember some things that we read a long time ago.\\nI am happy to know that it will be a book about Catherine which is a wonderful character and I would like to see some of the older supporting characters, like Logan., I loved this book.  It's beautifully written and the characters are well developped.  Nicole confronts her fears like any one of us would do and not like the heroine of a book, she goes step by step, fighting with her doubts till the last minute when she has no choice but to step on the plane.  And there she continues with the fighting, she will fight every day of her life.  And the end is open for speculation or maybe a saga.  It's not important, you can close it yourself.\\nRead it, it's worth it., I loved this book.  Be prepared at the end to cry, it is a very emotional and hot romance.  It's been a long time since I've read a book that I liked so much.  The characters are true to themselves.  What I don't understand are the bad reviews, this book is well written and the characters well developped.  It is worth every one of the five stars., I have read only two Andersen books and this one was really fun to read. This book has funny moments, sweet moments and hot moments. Macy is a loving and lovable character and the chemistry between her and Gabe is hot, as hot as the fires that Gabe puts out when he is working. It is true that this is a predictable romance but I think is is well written and worth to be read., The plot was very interesting and it was what kept me going when the descriptions of the feelings of the characters for each other were out there repeating themselves ad nauseum. This book could have been a lot shorter ( and believe me I love long books when they are good and they ade long for a reason) and IMO it would have been better. It wasn't bad but I've found myself skipping parts in the middle because of their \"longueur\"., I am a huge fan of Marsha Canham's books and there were only 3 that I hadn't read:  Chine Rose, Bound by the heart and The wind and the sea.  Now I am happy that she released them on Kindle giving me the opportunity to read them!  I've read Bound by the Heart and I fell in love with the book.  It's really a good book and I assure you you can't put it down.  The intrigue is well spinned and the characters well done.\\nAt the moment I am reading China Rose and loving it and waiting for The wind and the sea.\\nA must read book!, I've read 15 books in this series and all are very good. I love the characters, Roarke with the contrast of tough businessman and loving husband, Eve with the damaged soul and caring for the victims of violence, Summerset the mysterious butler and all the other secondary characters. In each book Eve's and Roarke's past and history is revealed a bit further and you have also the who dunnit mystery of each murder. Each book can be read separately but if you read the series in order is better because you gain to know each character more and more. And this book doesn't disappoint, I loved every one of the books I've read in this series. The more interesting thing in them are the characters, even if the plot is very good too. The best thing is to read them in order but you can read them individually too. But if you read them in order you will have a better hold on Eve's and Roarke's story. IMO they are great to take with you on holidays to the beach. I've have read at least 15 of them and they don't disappoint!, This is my first book by Ms Bretton and it was a very nice surprise.  I loved the story and the characters are engaging.  They are not perfect and this is what makes them so likable and they are not judgmental as in some books that when the h or H discovers the secret the other is keeping and they go nuts and almost destroy the relationship.  The development flows in a natural manner and the characters have natural dialogs even if this remains a romance and evidently there are some elements out of reality but they are credible in the romance world. It was a very emotional story, sweet, romantic and it felt like being enveloped by a cozy blanket.\\n I would like to know the story of some of the supporting characters like Hall. So I will be reading more books of this author., It took me sometime to get to this book once I downloaded it, maybe because the idea of reading about fires didn't appeal to me at the time but once I began reading I couldn't put it down. This is a great book with adventure, romance and a great insight in human psychology.  The caracters are endearing and really human not some paper invention., This is the first book I read by Ms. Alessandro and I absolutely loved it.  Now I am searching for the next book by her!, I began reading this book not knowing what to expect. Usually I don't read horror books but this one was a very good story. It kept me spell ound reading wanting to know how it would end. The plot was twisted, a good twiste, and the characters felt real. Loved it. The only thing was that the Kindle edition had some editing problems., The story was great. I loved it even if it kept me sleeping very badly because I was really immersed in it. Usually I don't read horror or supernatural stories but I am glad I did. The only bad thing was the formatting that made the reading difficult., Lovely story. It has it all, a fast paced plot, adventure, intrigue, humor, a wonderful hero and although the heroine was hideous to him it goes well in the story because is justified by her personal history.\\nIt is the second book I read by Miriam Minger and the first historical romance by her and I loved it as much as the other one (Ripped Appart). I had this book for free and I just bought the second book in THE MAN OF MY DREAMS SERIES, My Runaway Heart. Ms Minger you have a new fan of your books!, I love this series and this book was all I hoped for.  It has an interesting plot, adventure, suspense... it has you wondering, what's next? It was difficult to put it down and I enjoyed it very much BUT, and for me this is a big but, there are some grammar problems: We're/Were, you're/your, drug/drag and others.  These are only some examples.  The price of this book is not $0.99 and this author is not a beginner either so please, grammar IS important to give your book a good name. I say this because the book is really good and I think it is a pity to deface it with bad grammar when it is possible to correct this. I say this with all respect and I repeat, this is a very good story., Don't search for reality in this book.  I loved it as an escapist story and it made me sigh in pleasure.  This is a great book to read when you are on a vacation to escape reality and inmerse you in a great fantasy. It is a very sweet story, well written and it made me daydream. The characters,principal or secondary, are dears and engaging.  For me this author is new and now I am buying the next one in this series because I absolutely want to know Joe story. I highly recommend this book., I have read more than 30 books by Ms Deveraux and usually I like them very much.  Some of them I loved, others were very funny but this book was very disappointing.  The characters were very weak and I had the feeling that they were only a sketch and not totally finished.  They had only two dimensions and I couldn't be atracted or attached to them.  The plot could have been interesting if the characters could collaborate but they seemed not to be interested.  The dialogues were disjointed and empty. The problem with this book was not the intention to make a different romance without sex, I think sex in a romance book is great but not essencial for a great one., I liked this book.  It was a nice and sweet story with just the right amount of angst and emotion.  The characters were charming and engaging, the main and supporting ones.  The plot is interesting and it flows very well.\\nThe only thing is there were grammar and spelling mistakes, not so much to be distracting but some were hilarious, I think they were produced by autocorrect.  One of them, that came all the time was the word \"feet\" each time it was supposed to be \"fact\", another one \"fete\" instead of \"fate\".  This is only a minor thing.\\nAll in all is a very nice book., Well, I haven't yet finished the book but I have to agree with the ppl that say that this book is not good.  It's true that it's the first time that I read a romance that goes on the erotica genre.  I have read some classic erotica very explicit also but well written and I can't say the same thing about \"The Irish Devil\".  The plot begins in a very interesting way and the characters seem also interesting but after one or two chapters all is only an excuse for sex and not sex as a consequence of the storyline.\\nI will try to finish it because I hate to leave a book unread in the middle but  I don't think I am going to buy another book by this author., I've read this book some months ago and I don't remember all the details but some of the other people resumed it in detail.  What I remember and stayed with me was that it is a very well written story with true characters and a very interesting storyline.  It's a story about mothers and daughters, coming of age and human relationships.  Maybe you have to be a mother or a daughter or both to enjoy it and this is why some of the critics weren't good.  I don't know but I enjoyed it and I recommend it., I agree with one of the reviewers who says that it seems that two storylines put together to make a book.  But it is not a bad reading.  It could be better but it is entertaining.]   \n",

This was a fun addition to our camping trip in the Sierra's this Summer.  I don't know if it would be considered \"professional grade\", but it worked for us., It's white ribbon.  Quality is good., Initial review: This stuff is amazing.  If tames fly-aways, smoothes frizziness and speeds blowdrying.  I ue it every time I wash may hair.  I also use it on my duaghters hair as a detangler.  Unscented, very natural looking when your hair is dry.\\n\\nAdditional notes: After almost two years of use I stopped using this product.  I have heard the silicone can dry out your hair, and I did notice that when I did not have the product in my hair, it was more and more brittle.  Since discontinuing use, my hair has become less brittle and stronger.  I would no longer recommend this for every day use, though occasionally it's nice to get that super sleek look..., I don't know what people are complaining about.  We have had this peeler for 6 months, using almost daily for carrots, and often for potatoes and apples.  For the price it is a great deal.  Ours is stamped Linden Sweden.  I prefer that it is all metal, the rubber handles tend to become sticky and dirty., I don't know what people are complaining about.  We have had this peeler for 6 months, using almost daily for carrots, and often for potatoes and apples.  For the price it is a great deal.  Ours is stamped Linden Sweden.  I prefer that it is all metal, the rubber handles tend to become sticky and dirty., Well made and easy to wipe clean.  Kind of small - fine for a kids lunch, but doesn't hold much more than a sandwich and a few snacks.  (Maybe I'm a pig?) Only an 8 oz. bottle will fit in here., These are cute and sturdy tis.  They arrived on time and as described.  Some people are saying they are small.  The dimensions are clearly listed, and they worked fine for cookies.  I would buy these again., This is an updated review.  These sheets are super soft, however, after 1.5 years, the bottom sheet is completely shredded.  I don't know, I guess I expected them to last longer.  They were always washed on permanent press and dried on medium heat.  I'm bummed., This is super cute and easy to put together.\\nHowever, one of the bottom swirls arrived bent, so the tray didn't sit flat.  I carefully tried to bend it into place, and one of the connections snapped.  That being said, I think my husband can fix it, and I will be able to use it for the event I purchased it for this weekend.\\nThe fact that it can collapse is very convenient, and it really is a cute design.  I will use for cupcakes, and also as a centerpiece.  For the price, I am happy with the purchase.\\nI wold have gien 5 stars if not for the crumby construction., My box arrived on time with each piece individually wrapped.  Nothing was broken or damaged.  My only complaint is that the colors I received were very dark.  Not exactly as pictured., Arrived on time and as stated.  nice selection of polished amethyst.  the items I received looked jus like the image online., Fits my MacBook air, protects the computer.  Zipper is sturdy and fully functional.  Color is as shown.  It is neoprene, so it stinks.  Give it a few days to air out before using.  Great value., Well made backpack - beware that this specific color - Tahitian Orange - is a pink based orange - my son was having none of it.  Other than that, its a great pack., Well made, color is true to online image.  There are pencil keeper pockets sewn into in the small front pocket.  Double zipper on the large opening.  Functional and stylish., We went theough a winter with no leaks or cracks and hard wear and tear.  The soles are sturdy and they are wide enough in the shaft for my 2 year old to get them on and off herself., I have coveted Hunter boots forever, but could not bring myself to shell out over $140 for rain boots.  I settled on these b/c they were made in Canada (instead of China), had good reviews and looked cute.  Like other reviews mention, these are narrow in the shaft.  They are perfect with skinny or straight leg jeans on a thin legged girl.\\nThese run small.  I normally wear an 8-8.5 and ordered the 8. I should have gotten the 9.  The foot bed is just long enough with thin socks, and I almost had a panick attck trying to get them off the first time.  (The ankles are also narrow which makes them tough to get off!)\\nThe brown color is more like a black cherry, and it is actually a clear covering over the neoprene liner, which is a very cool look.\\nI have been wearing them daily in the creek (literally)  no leaks so far.  I would recomend these boots!, Perfect cotton socks with elastic.  True to size.  These have held up well, and my son is hard on socks.  They have padding in the footbed, which is a nice touch.  They go to mid-calf when pulled up all the way.  I will purchase again., Well made backpack - beware that this specific color - Tahitian Orange - is a pink based orange - my son was having none of it.  Other than that, its a great pack., A snug fit.  order up if you don't wan t it to be skin tight.  Nice bright color and decently send seams., Cute socks.  Good quality.  I wish they were more cotton, less other materials., Good swim trunks.  Color is vibrant, they are well made.  The waist tie is functional.  There is a brief mesh insert.  Cargo pockets are functional.  Fabric is lightweight and quick drying.  I would recommend these shorts., This coat is warm and thick without being super bulky.  I ordered the 10-12 for my tall 8 year old.  Sleeves are about right and the coat doesn't hang too long.  Hood is not removable.  Color is true to online image.  - we got the deep wave color.  Hood is adjustable, but not removable., These shoes are super cute, and really bright.  They almost seem to glow in the dark, which is fine with me. As with most ASICs, they are a little wide in the toes.  I have purchased the GT-2000 in the past, and loved them.  These could use a little more arch support.  Not a deal breaker, but I may buy some supports to add in., So much easier to throw this on than apply sunscreen over back and shoulders.  Great fit and it doesn't stretch out too much when wet.  Has held up well to multiple cold water washings and extreme chlorine exposure (community pool!)\\nThe chevron pattern on the back is slimming.  Very cute!, I ordered a medium/Large.  The robe is plenty wide, but the sleeves are just to my wrists - I am 5-8.  I'm afraid that when I wash, it'll shrink.  I'm afraid to order a Large/XL because i think the body of the robe will be huge., Terrible.  This bra has almost no stretch, which is exactly what a compression bra is supposed to have.  I wear a 34C.  I could barely get the size medium over my head.  (I do not have large shoulders.)\\nOnce the bra was on, it was extremely tight around my rib cage, but didn't stop my breasts from bouncing at all.  I would have thought that it was too large, but I had major side boob and I was also busting out over the top of the bra.  Sending back.  Sigh., These are nice under the Anglefish shoes, and don't show.  I wear an 8 1/2 shoe, so I ordered the med/large size, and they are a bit big.  I'd order the smaller size if I was to purchase again., This is a very basic slip.  Straps are not adjustable.  I would purchase in advance and make sure it works with the dress you need to wear it with.  Doesn't ride up.  True to size.  Did not generate stay cling.  A good foundation piece., I like the look of these shoes, but I don't think they provide as much cushion as the Asics GT2000 that I have worn in the past.  I've only had them a week, but I've gotten in several runs.  They just aren't great., This product is as described and was easy to put together - the horns and topping snap into place.  The horns are so large and heavy however, that it makes the hat unstable. It doesn't really stay on adults or children.  We bought this for my sons Halloween costume, and it won't stay on his head.  We have tried adding some foam padding inside the helmet, but it hasn't helped.  I think if he actually wants to wear it we'll have to poke holesin the sides and add an elastic band to run under his chin..., These definitely ran small, and were not super stretchy.  They were however truly metallic.  We used for the bottom of a robot costume., This is a great sweatshirt  Note it is mens sizing, and fit.  Classic puffy fit with fitted wrist and waist, which is what I wanted.  I am 5-8, 145 and I ordered the medium.  It was very large before washing, but has shrunken down, and is slightly fitted in the bust, but loose around the middle.  The color is vibrant burgundy.  You can use the hood., Arrived on time and as stated, but two of them had snags or broken when we tried to tighten the strings.  No liner, but fine a goodie or dice bags, This dress has an odd fit.  Cons: The cups are very long, and were not super flattering on me.  You can see gapping on some of the images posted by other reviewers.  Bottom half of the dress was super tight on the hips.  Straps are made of round elastic?\\nPros: Beautiful floral print.  The thick \"scuba\" material of the dress would hide flaws., This is a great summer top.  It is lose without being baggy, and looks \"put together\" while still being a cool cotton t shirt.  I ordered a medium - I am 5'9'', 145 lbs, the fit is just right.  Long enough and flowy, but still structured around the shoulders and bust.  The line down the center of the shirt is a little weird looking, I think I would have prefered it without, but I still like the shirt and will wear it lots this summer. I wish it came in more colors than the traffic cone orange and black..., This is a cute necklace.  The seashell opens, but it is very tiny, it would be hard to actually put a photo in it.  We ought this to wear for a Halloween Mermaid costume, and my daughter was very happy with it., Wow, I doubted this dress, but it is really great.  I ordered a medium - I am 5-8 145.  The fit is snug but not too tight.  The arm openings are a little odd, but for the price, not a problem.  The top is modest, and the dress hits at my knees.  These is no liner or petticoat, so it will need a slip.  The stitching is the back is a little off, but not noticeable and doesn't affect the fit too negatively.\\nSome people mentioned stains or marking on the light colored dresses - I did not see any of this., This dress is super flattering.  The pros: The pattern shift at the waist really draws it in.  The green color is vibrant and bold.  This dress is long, I am 5-9 and a large landed just above my knees.  This is kind of a good thing because it really hugs your curves, so having the dress be a little longer balances everything out.\\nThe cons: Thin material requires a slip if you are going to be wearing this outdoors in natural light.  it isn't see through, but it shows EVERYTHING.  I would have given 5 stars for thicker material.\\nOverall - for the price, a fantastic buy!, This is a cute, lightweight summer dress.  The yellow color is a deep sunflower, which isn't great for my skin tone, but is a very nice color.  I am 5-8, 140 and I bought the medium.  It fits well.  There is a mix of different textures and fabric mediums to the dress, which is fun.  The V in front is a bit deep, but not scandalous.  I have been machine washing and drying with good results., The long/tall feature is great if you have a skinny kid.  Finally pants that fit well, are well made and can withstand play.  My son is tall and super skinny.  These fit him and are a great price., This is a very cute and comfortable suit.  Fit is as expected.  I normally wear a 6 or 8, I went with an 8 and it is perfect.  There is a built in shelf bra with very firm removable pads.  I ended up removing them because I was afraid they would look odd when wet.  The suit is fine without the pads, or you could also use a different pair of pads/liners if you are concerned with nipple coverage.  The thin straps are adjustable, and have nice looking gold hardware.  My only complaint is that there could be a little more support in the bust.  The chef bra doesn't do much.\\nThe color is true to the online image, and is a nice vibrant purple.\\nThe shirring on the side is flattering.  I know some reviewers have compared it to maternity wear, however, if you have a somewhat fat stomach, it is fine.\\nRear end coverage is moderate, and flattering., This is a great kids sweatshirt.  It is thick and fluffy.  It shrunk a LOT though.  I ordered a 10-12 for my eight year old.  Before the first wash he was swimming in it.  After a wash and dry though, it is perfect.  Roomy, but not huge.  The color is vibrant green., Adorable and well made coat!  I would order up through if you want to ear a sweater underneath it, they run little small, I had to return and order up a size.  Color is super vibrant, buttons are functional., I am tired of little girls swim suits looking like Victoria's Secret. This swim suit is super cute and stylish -  while still being modest and comfortable.  (I kind of wish they had an adult version)\\nI would say these are true to size.  Well Made.  Not see thorough - which I was worried about with the white stripes.  The back is high and the straps stay in place., Adorable and well made.  Nice back zipper.  My daughter loves this dress. Runs true to size, Nice quality line shirt, but my husband usually wears  medium, and this was tight across the back, and he is slim.  Ending up sending back., Well made backpack - beware that this specific color - Tahitian Orange - is a pink based orange - my son was having none of it.  Other than that, its a great pack., These are perfect for a tall, slim kid!  They are cut narrower, so it doesn't look like a think child is swimming in them.  (both the waist and the width of the legs is skinnier.  These are great for my tall and slim son., Finally pants for tall skinny boys!  Another reviewer commented that these are like a size 8 waist with a size 10 length - this is true, and great.  My son is tall and skinny, and these are perfect.  He is 8, I ordered the 8 and they fit very well.  Adjustable interior hidden belt is helpful.  Note: back pockets are false - just flaps.  I am okay with this, and they actually fall better because of it.  Cargo pockets and front pockets are real.  I ordered another pair in the gray this week.  These are casual enough for every day, but could be dressed up for a more formal event., These look great and are comfortable enough to wear all day, though I found my feet to be sore the NEXt day after wearing them all day and walking.  They really do look great, and the heel height is tall enough to look professional without killing you.  Very well made - as you would expect from Cole Haan., This is a small backpack, for a child under 5 years old.  It looks rather cheaply made, but the zipers are still intact after 6 months.  My daughter uses it regularly., When wet, this top gets a little droopy.  Seems to be holding up well, and definitely protects from the sun.  Color in photo is true to life.  Wish I would have gotten a lighter color though, as it\\ns hot when not in the water..., This suit is very cute from the front.  the v neck is flattering, and the shelf bra is supportive.\\nFrom the back, the deep v low back is also very cute and flattering.  In fact, I love it!\\nThe issue I had with this suit is that the back bottom straps ran right across by shoulder bones, making the suit feel awkward and uncomfortable.  I tried pulling the traps down over, and up higher, but it just didn't work for me.  Bummer because otherwise I would highly recommend.  The fit might be different for other wearers, but I had to send it back., Very cute dress!  All cotton with a vibrant print.  Easy on-off with a stretchy neck and arms.  Pink sash is full removable.  My daughter loves wearing this dress and has gotten lots of compliments on it.  Knee length., I ordered the white version of this dress, for the price, it is well made.  The one size fits most is true - I am 5-8, 145 and the dress fits fine, however, the smocking doesn't go down as far as I would like.  Because of my height, the smocking doesn't go down to my waist and stops in an awkward spot on my rib cage.  That being said, I still wear it around, and I have gotten compliments on the dress.  I was hoping to wear to a wedding, but it just isn't that flattering.  HOWEVEr, if you are shorted, this dress would be great., Runs small compared to other kids clothes., Very cute girls dress.  Runs a little small.  It's hard to tell in the image online, but the lace and flowers are like graphically printed on the dress?  the effect is cute and stylish.  Dress is very light weight and would be good for summer.  My daughter likes it a lot.  The orange color looks kind of pink on line, but it is definitely more orange than red/pink.  This dress has a more sophisticated look than many little girls dresses, which I liked for a change., Bought these as a replacement for a pair I had worn completely through.  A true straight leg jean, good quality.  Inseam is about 33.5 inches on a size 29., My husband has switched to linen. Cool and soft.  Slightly roomier fit than he is used to, but not baggy.  It somehow manages to look relaxed and polished at the same time., Good quality and super cute.  I ordered a 6 for my soon to be 5 year old.  the cut is very long and slim which is nice, but if you have a heavier/shorter child, this might not be the best cut.  Or, order up.  Coat color is true to online image - a bright melon color.  Hood is not detachable.  Scarf is.  Fleece lining in the hood is a nice tough., Cute sandals that appear to be well made  - we did get blisters on the few first wears.  Also, the back zippers are tough to pull up and down.  I am hoping they will last through the summer.  The buckle are tiny, which look great but are a little hard to manipulate., These seem to have more stretch than other 7 jeans I have purchased.  I don't love the twill look, but the fit is excellent, so I kept them.\\nI purchased a 29, and the fit is perfect.  As a reference I am 5-8 and 145 lbs. These are ankle grazing., Very cute but the back heel cup goes straight up and down and it very stiff.  This left an odd gap between by heel/ankle and the shoe.  They just din't fit great.  I also had to pay to send them back, sad face., Great for pajama pants.  A little long, which is great for my tall/thin son., The sizing chart on this item is all crazy.  I ordered a 12 bassoon the sizing, and it was super large.  I returned it for an 8 hoping for a better fit.  Nice construction.  A bit see through - there is no liner.  Also, wish it came with a carrying case so I could throw it in the car.  BUT, still a cute alternate to boring rain coats., Nice style and well constructed.\\nThe pros: style, comfort.\\nThe blue suede is a nice light color, with a good contract to the white, but not so much that it limits the options of what I can wear them with.  I like that these do not have a bulky sole.\\nThe cons - they are leather, and though they are white shoes, my feet are kind of hot in them.  (no vents/mesh/perforations)\\nSizing: The sizing is average.  I would say these are slightly narrow, and perhaps run a little long.  I usually wear a 8/8.5.  I probably could have squeezed into an 8 in these.  I bought the 8.5 and they are a nit long, but still fine.)\\nI would purchase these shoes again., Fun suit. Comes with very awkward pads that can be removed.  Back is adjustable. I wish the bottom seem was a little more substantial, it feels like the top could ride up.\\nBottom run small and are super low cut.  I plan to wear the top with a plan black bottom.\\nPretty well made for a suit that costs under $20., This runs small, it is more like a tunic than a dress.  The material is some sort of synthetic.  The print is vibrant though and the dress is very cute overall.]   \n",

I have purchased at least 6 of these mink blankets over the years.  You will not be disappointed., Beautiful way to add a little Christmas to your wardrobe., I paid $7 for these and you can't even buy good pills inserts that cheap. very nice., I always wanted one and now I have one.  It is accurate and is also nice to use just as a timer., Great for desk at work. Light, quiet., Not as easy as the other one I had where rubber bulb screwed on., I love this thing - I use it constantly.  The battery lasts for around 15-18 minutes.  You may not think that is a lot, but for quick cleanups it is perfect.  It can't replace a big vacuum, but for a quick clean up of dog hair or crumbs....excellent!, Bought these years ago...bought a set here when I ran across them. Come in handy and work well., Didn't read close enough. Thought it was a cordless like my other one. Decided to keep it to use upstairs plug works fine in that area, Perfect for someone with no counter space....., Beautiful set. A bit lighter than I expected, but definitely non stick. Haven't put in dishwasher yet., Perfect fit  - worked well.  Pretty easy to replace old one., Works just like it says - roll little balls, put in small muffin tins and use the tamper - works perfect., This one is loud when it is on high and doesn't have an automatic sensor.  Go with the Airinstinct HEPA Large Room Air Purifier.  I have that one too and wish I would have just gotten two of those.  I know this one has a lifetime filter, but it is loud on high - too  loud., If you are debating whether to get this one or the Dual Max Air Purifier with the lifetime filter - go with this one.  It is much quieter and it has an automatic sensor that adjusts as needed.  Kinda looks like a giant iPhone and the color sensor lets you know the degree of odors it is filtering., Nice burgundy color. Fit queen bed well., It is a marked improvement over the French Corningware that doesn't have handles - got it for a great price. Went back to order one for my daughter and it wasn't available at that price., Such a simple idea and so darn cute.  I have several different kinds on my window sill at work and I love them.  Everyone comments on them.  I tell them I stare at them and go to my happy place - you can't help swaying along with them., Hubby loves this on his recliner. Second one I ordered so he can rotate. I was in regular washer., It is quiet - not a very \"strong\" air current.  I bought for the kitchen, but ended up moving it to the bedroom for night time use., Love these mugs. Bought the set in September. I broke the blue one and came back to order another set and the price has just about doubled. I paid $22 for the set of 6 mugs. Not ordering again unless the price drops drastically., Beautiful. Fits my queen bed perfectly. Love it.\\nIt's a little more on the red side than burgundy but it matches my bedroom great., I do like having these utensils easily accessible on the counter and that magnets hold them together., Nice burgundy color, soft, washes well. Great sheets for bargain price., Great price for soft, beautiful sheets.  I ordered two more sets. Burgundy color is true burgundy., It is very pretty, but much more purple than burgundy.  The color was listed as burgundy red - not maroon.  Was going to return, but decided to keep to use somewhere else.  Wish it came in more of the burgundy color as the other Chanasya throw I purchased., I put two of these on my glass top stove to avoid the fingerprints, and unfortunately little cat paw prints and smudges that always show up., It holds garbage....so that means it works!, Nice. Fit queen size well. Not sure how it would go in a king. Came back for s navj blue one. Brown is a rich dark chocolate., It is big and locks securely.  The handle is perfect for taking along to picnics or gatherings.  You will not be disappointed with this item.  I am thinking of ordering another one., Melted every time I used them., Perfect addition to my Rachael Ray set.  Definitely dishwasher safe - not discoloration., I like it - but the top part could be a bit bigger to accommodate cups that should stand up - like for soup.  Bpttom part is very large and fits lots of stuff!, Wish I would have known about these prior to all the shams I bought to match comforters and such expense prices - I will definitely just go to these to order a color that matches the print of the comforters and quilts., Love the clock...first one came cracked. Second one never kept time correctly. I ended up ordering new clock guys to put in myself. No more loud ticking noise with this fix either. Kept it because I loved the look of the clock., Love these.  Perfect to freeze when you make big batches of soup or chili and want to grab one to take to work for lunch., I used to love them.  Until the one earbud stopped working....just a few months into owning them., Got the blue one...very nice sky blue shade I might add, to replace a red apple cover I stained. It is very comparable. Still have no idea what the little bag of gizmos and gadgets that came with it are for. Some little things to plug the holes for the headphones and charging adapter I'm guessing. But no idea what the little blue thing is that looks like a fish skeleton or the thing that looks like a paper clip....does anyone know. Came without any directions for instal of cover...lucky fir me I'm pretty self sufficient....just be sure attach the back to the front before putting it on. Install takes seconds., I prefer a gel pen - but these are great when you are using a iPad or iPhone and using a pen at the same time to jot down notes on paper.  Like these much better than the ones with the stylus on the top., Variety makes this product very nice.  I use it instead of a lanyard for my id tag at work., Color is perfect - definitely size up.  I usually wear an XL - I bought a 3X.  I have ordered many sweaters in this style - sizing differs, but they are definitely made small., Bought these in several colors. Some fit better than others  made small. Took some time for delivery. I'd order again., Nice sweater. Definitely size up. I got a 3XL because I like them roomy. I wear a large...this fit like an XL, I ordered an XXL - I usually need a L to fit like this one did.  Well made and very true hunter green color.  Also ordered a royal blue - also a very true color., Beautiful green color, long enough for leggings., I got them for my second hole in my ear - so they are perfect for that.  I had another pair, but lost one so I priced one in a jewelry store and they wanted almost $70 for one to match.  I would recommend for the the quality and price., I bought this snowflake to replace one I lost.  Found the other one, but actually like this one more than the one I originally lost.  It is very sparkly and very pretty., Actually had to order a new pair, since I lost one from the set my son bought me!  At least now I have an extra one!, Nice, but very clunky and noisey links on handle., Christo did a fantastic job making sure I had exactly what I wanted. The bar was a bit smaller than I had expected, but I think I like it even more this way.  Very delicate a dainty. He made a small adjustment to lengthen the necklace a bit for my taste. It was perfect. I ordered a cheap one months ago from another seller because I couldn't find what I wanted and was afraid to order a real gold one on line. I'm glad I took the chance with Jewelery Affairs. I would not hesitate to do business with them again. Ordered on a Tuesday, custimiized and delivered on Friday., I have another brand that is the supposed to be the same size and they fit so much better than these.  I ended up sending these back and just cutting the toes out of the ones I had.  Just seemed more comfortable without the toes.  I used them after vein surgery., Wish they were a little looser at the thigh....better yet, wish I had smaller thighs!, Its big and it's heavy but it has been a life saver keeping track of my cat when he gets out at night., Love the pump instead of pouring.  Perfect fit for Torani and DaVinci brand 25.4 oz bottles, Love the pump instead of pouring.  Perfect fit for Torani and DaVinci brand 25.4 oz bottles, Yummy, I bought Donut Shop Coffee because of the sample that came with my Keurig that I loved.  I must say that from the first cup I had from this 50 pack it was defintely not the same quality as the sample I tried.  Now I am fearful of buying the 50 pack boxes.  And I am new to the Keurig - did not know the price of the 50 pack had gone up so much - at $30.00 a box now, doesn't seem worth trying another kind.  Now I am just plain scared of wasting my money on a 50 pack for fear that the same thing will happen with another flavor.]   \n",
       "883  [Loved it! Ordered as a Christmas gift, kind of late in the game, and made a last minute change; however, set arrived on time with the requested changes! Great set and customer service! Definitely a quality set..., I love how easy it is to buy and use the Amazon gift cards. I've never had a problem with balances or anything like that. If you have and use a Kindle a lot, definitely worth keeping one for purchasing books!, Balls are a good size and don't hit against my teeth like metal balls! They're also really pretty!, The chain is pretty short, but otherwise I love this collar. It will look lovely on my pet..., Arrived on time and seems very fancy. My husband is going to love this set and feel like hes a real chef...just has that feel and look!, Very pretty but on the small side., Love it....perfect fit and sexy!, If I could give this less than one star I would. I thought I was reading child porn. I guess I don't see an 18 yr old high school student as an adult. I surely don't want to read about them masturbating. Couldn't even finish this book.  Just felt wrong!, But I would have liked it a lot more if in the end Macy would have gotten a tattoo. If you've read the book Wrong Bed, Right Guy and you liked it, you'll enjoy this book as well., What can I say? It's a predictable book, but still an enjoyable read. I felt that Ethan was genuine and real with his feelings for Amy. Even when it was a sham, I could tell he had real feelings for her, which is why although I loved the book I didn't like Amy. She was so doubtful and just ridiculous! All of her questioning his motives instead of appreciating his actions was annoying!, So I almost didn't finish. It's listed as a contemporary romance, but it's really just lust at first sight (at least first sight as adults) and not enough story to make you believe that it turned into love. I mean I've heard the saying the best way to get over one man is to get under another but I don't think it's meant to be taken literally. I mean who gets dumped on their wedding day and immediately starts feeling attraction and lust and want for another man. I mean who does that sober? I didn't like how that unfolded or came about straight from the start, but I also didn't like Jenny's character. There was really not other way to put it, she was a gold digger. She was looking for security (financial) and she became someone else (and hid her family) in order to marry someone she didn't even look and who she felt she had to become someone different for. That's not love...I didn't get love from anywhere in this story. I usually love the hero in most romances, but Colton didn't even get me excited. You rescue a damsel in distress and the first thing you think about is bedding her...boooo!, Especially at Christmastime. It made me wistful. Although I thought it was a short time to fall in love, the story fit well with the idea of Christmas magic. I also liked that there was no drama, well there was but nothing drug out. Perfect Christmas romance!, This is a cute, fun love story. From the beginning the relationship between Bri and Ryan is explosive. Of course, it's kind of predictable, but still a really good read. It even has a few steamy parts for those loving for something a little sexy!, And this book got the bill.\\n\\nFinally a book I could get behind the heroine. Nice little romance even if the author didn't give enough character to the leading male for me to really see why Margaret was in love with him. I guess being tall, dark and handsome was enough., Like the first book, this one also takes you on an emotional rollercoaster. Jason Ryker is the type of husband every girl dreams she'll find!\\n\\nKate is stronger than she realizes and an awesome example of girl power! She has her issues but she works it out with the support of her husband,family and friends? Great story and characters throughout. Definitely a little steamer than book one!, But Gillian doesn't get what she deserves.\\n\\nWhen I started reading this I really thought it was going to be a carbon copy of Devotion, but the author did a great job changing the storyline. There always has to be drama and it was the perfect amount (as in not too much) and the ending was good (even though I would have liked an epilogue with them married and a pregnancy)! I know that would have been too scripted!\\n\\nGood job Ms. Hawthorne...and I like that you're putting Latinas on the scene!, Nathan and Amy were sweet.\\n\\nAt first I didn't feel the main characters had enough interaction to fall in love, but it was more about rediscovery. True love never dies and can overcome any obstacle., What can I say, who doesn't love a cowboy? Matt was the sweetest. I like that this novel was short and to the point, yet descriptive and full. I definitely appreciated there was no big drama. I wouldn't mind reading a sequel!, What I really liked about this story was that it was straightforward. The characters spoke to what they were feeling instead of the mind reading game. Also, if felt very real.  The only thing I could say I didn't like was that it was a bit predictable, but all in all great love story about true love prevailing!, Simply a love story....minimal drama. Really beautiful.\\n\\nI read this in one sitting. I couldn't put it down. It's a different twist on the shifter relationship and it felt genuine. Loved Renner and the fact that it didn't take Bethany forever to come around!, I love this Christian series! Great story line and ability to keep it fresh vice telling the same ole story but with different character names.\\n\\nIt was a quick romance, but believable. I enjoyed it!, How I felt about this book. It was obvious to me who the admirer was so I didn't like the attraction Bella expressed for the \"rival\". She just seemed really disloyal. Overall worth the read but don't expect to fall in love with the leading lady., Is for the steamy parts; however, the plot is rather ridiculous! I can appreciate a quick, world-wind romance, but under these circumstances I couldn't believe. Also, one description was \"dirty face\"....not appealing or sexy., Read this is two days. The author managed to keep it roughneck and sexy while changing the MC against MC storyline. I liked the new angle and can't wait to read the next one!, For a short novel this book managed to include some drama, romance, and suspense! I thoroughly enjoyed the male lead and of all the shifter books I've read this was a unique Claim., Nice story line and really sweet, but same formula as the others. I know these are Christian romances but they're all so perfect and neat!\\n\\nI can't wait to read Mac's story!\\n\\nBe forewarned...there are some errors!, This book was a good read, but at the same time felt kind of random and definitely felt unfinished. I liked how the characters met and some of the storylines that unfolded seemed to be rushed to their ending. I think this book is a stand alone but it needs a part two to feel complete., My favorite Donahue brother! This is a great series and I strongly recommend to anyone who just loves love! This really just makes you feel good...I loved it! A couple of errors with the writing, but still a great read!, I read Nail Down first and absolutely loved it so I gave this a go.  The wording and storyline are very similar to that book, but I still enjoyed reading this one. I will say it's a little sexier and has a little more drama, which makes it stand a part. And Nash is a damn sexy name!  Great read..., And fit well with the image of Ares!\\n\\nThis is another great novel from this author. I think she did a great job in telling the same story (bear finding and fighting for his mate) but making it different and still very interesting! Kat is a heroine you can root for and Ares is definitely a god....a big sexy one!, Outside of the shifter angle, I think this has been one of the \"realest\" books I've read! It wasn't perfect, perfect man, perfect woman and perfect sex....even the drama was real.\\n\\nDefinitely a surprised treat!, You know how its going to end at the beginning, but its still worth the read. I love books where the man falls for the entire family., Big strong bear is right...loved this book as much as the others! Again the author managed to tell a completely different story even though it was the same. I would say the only thing I didn't like was that Cassie was also a bear! I think it's something so sexy when it's a human female and a shifter, but definitely still worth the read! Nice spin that you may not be able to predict., Of the three McAllister brothers. I actually couldn't finish book 2, but I knew Maverick's would be funny and it didn't disappoint. I liked Maverick's wildness, boldness and dominance. I didn't necessarily care for Harmony too much. She played some games and I didn't think she was worthy of Maverick, but in the end I was glad how it worked out.\\n\\nRead if you're up for a funny (albeit a little ridiculous), steamy romance. It even has a little drama., No matter how many shifter novels I read I always love the idea of mating...it seems so eternal and much deeper than just love and marriage. Anyway...\\n\\nAstride was awesome. I like her sassy character and her strength. The reason she needed extra money could have been stronger, but it still brought her to Victor and he was just ALPHA personified. I loved \"my life, my everything\" (swoon).\\n\\nGood, quick read!, And this is the third such book that Ive read in the past few days and its my least favorite. I didn't even want to finish it. The male character was cool, but this girl in this book was so spoiled and entitled and just too snobby to like. In the other books I read the women showed strength and had been up against adversity. I could see why those strong men wanted those women, I just didn't feel it in this book., This is the standard paranormal shifter romance, but you have the bonus of reading two love stories in the one book (sorry if that's a spoiler). I also thought it was kind of funny! Maybe because it was fluid, but it still worked., Where the Heart is with Natalie Portman and I definitely don't regret it. It was good from beginning to end. I didn't want to put it down. The characters had real issues without it being overly dramatic...it was just a really good, sweet read! Loved Nick and Maddie!, This book is terrible...just terrible! It's so bad I wish I could not only give it no stars I wish I could take it out of print so no one else can lie and give it stars! It's absolutely ridiculous....almost like reading a cartoon...and not even a cartoon for older children that teens and adults can enjoy but a really childish cartoon! I couldn't even finish! Some parts I was like blah blah blah...then others my jaw dropped with the ridiculousness! Thank goodness this was on KU because it is NOT worth paying for!, Not quite sure what the genre is supposed to be. It says paranormal mnage romance, but that's basically the side story. The main story is more mystery suspense. There is actually two stories here. The paranormal romance story actually feels like it ends early on then the new mystery story begins. I guess it was ok, two good plots just weird how they were combined. Also, the writing implies that the events take place over a significant period of time, at least months, but also states that it's only been weeks. Just all around conflicting and again weird!, It's predictable, but still a sweet read! Lee is a dream, handsome, rich, bear shifter, little Clara is adorable and Patricia is a prefect addition to their little family. Sweet how it all comes together., This book is a quick read, but that doesn't lessen the steamy. Flynn...holy hotness! His desire is over the top, more like obsession and almost creepy, but somehow the author makes it sexy.\\n\\nI was kind of disappointed at the female being a virgin because that storyline gets old and of course the almost ten year age gap, but still I enjoyed this book very much. If only finding your soulmate really happened like that...., I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review...and honestly it was a great book and storyline. It was a little old fashioned with the arranged marriage thing, but I still found it interesting and worth the read. I will say I would have preferred an older female character and that the relationship between the three was more developed. It was 85% of bratty bride and then in the last bit her admitting her attraction and being in to the relationship. It was the right amount of steamy and drama!\\n\\nI have to admit....I don't know that I've read anything that made the Russian Mafia seem appealing!, It took me awhile to get into the prologue, but this was a great book and added a mystical element to the story. I thought some of Bailey's actions were dumb, but other than that I was glad there was no unnecessary fighting and doubts between the mates, just them being straight up with each other. Can't wait for Mason's and the Bears stories., And now with this book has just taken a turn for the worse.  Way too much going on. First shifters, then witches and now vampires....way too much! Also, it's like many eras or time periods in one. The witches from their era and the shifters from this era, so the language is disconnected and it seems like the author is trying to hard to make it work....the YouTube and quoting hip hop lyrics...not a fan at all., Crazy, fast-paced erotic novel.  Also, a little funny and intriguing.  You want to know what's up with the characters.  You also want to be a part of this kind of town.  Good read so far...., I can't believe I wasted my time reading this. There was no rhyme or reason to it and it really wasn't very erotic!\\n\\nThis is not really a book at all. I don't even think it can be classified as a short. It's more like an excerpt. Stories need a start, some texture and then an end.  The author has a long way to go., Good storyline...fluid! I liked the main characters as well as the supporting characters. Quick read and most everything gets resolved. I would have liked to see how the relationship between Rory and Blane turned out but maybe that is revealed later in the series.\\n\\nRory and Darra are worth a read..., So this was definitely the worst book of the series. I didn't like Rona at all. Her \"stubbornness\" just came across as bratty and annoying. I really was like why can't a heroine be killed (I know that's terrible). When she just had to go play with her birds during a time of war, essentially, and those two guards were killed I was like she should go as well! And for Daniel to be this strong, strategic mind or whatever, he did not have a backbone when it came to her. Keeping someone safe and trying to take away their freedom are two different things. And them even having time for this leisurely thing also didn't seem realistic or smart considering what was on the horizon and their proximity to the danger.\\n\\nAlso, the whole secrets angle was kind of blah. Her secret was just dumb. I'm surprised no one noticed these birds flying and always returning to the same place, but whatever. But for her to be upset that Daniel didn't share strategic plans with her...I just couldn't.\\n\\nI really didn't like her character so it took me really long to even finish the book, but I wanted to see how the end came for Raef., That's very surprising. I'd actually give it about a 2.25 or 2.5 for effort. I finished it, but it was painful.\\n\\nFirst I thought the book was repetitive in parts. I can't tell you how many times Shiloh said now is our real first time. I also thought Shiloh was childish. She actually acknowledged in the book how she was behaving in a juvenile, high school manner, but she persisted....stalking, jumping to conclusions, never being an adult. I almost felt this was a new adult romance because even though they were supposedly older they were written really young.\\n\\nThere was also no character development. It was 97% over before Gentry told Shiloh his real name. How can you claim to be in love with a person whose name you don't know. Not only did she not know his name she didn't know anything about him. Everyone else did, but no one told her and she kept trying to get info from them, but never asked \"the man she loved\" directly. Also, I couldn't tell you anything about Shiloh either except her name and her job.\\n\\nShiloh for some reason always had tears in her eyes? I didn't get it! Also, the insecurity wasn't attractive. Then her statement, the power of blonde hair, huh?\\n\\nEssentially through the entire book, Shiloh was an adoring groupie...she acted like a groupie and let him treat her like one.\\n\\nIn the end, the spanking scene was embarrassing...not erotic at all and actually seemed out of place with the novel. Really, the whole sensual massage and denying orgasm was just thrown in there. Then she goes from being scared she made a mistake by moving the telescope to learning his real name to getting proposed to....just ridiculous! Glad this was free, but sad I bothered!, Probably the worst shifter novel I've read, but it was still fairly entertaining and a quick read. It was actually a good storyline, I just had a few eye rolling moments....silver bullets and love being the most powerful magic. Those two things had me thinking of werewolf movies and Frozen., Loved Dylan and Matt. Good storyline, but some issues are left unresolved even though there is no indication of a second book. Good choice if you're looking for an erotic paranormal romance..., Quality note cards and fairly large. I love them. They arrived quickly and were packaged to ensure they stayed protected., Engraving was free and looks really good.  Arrived quickly and packed well., Very durable. I've washed it several times because my son still loves to wear it!  I would definitely recommend as a Halloween costume or for purchase if your child just likes to dress up., I thought it was a cute love story. It kind of reminded me of the book On Dublin Street. I love a story when the characters are met to be together., One of my favorite books.  I read it once or twice a year.  It is a classic romance., Because I saw an article in a magazine that said if I liked Fifty Shades, I'd like this trilogy.  Well, the magazine was wrong.  It's not that the book is awful, it just wasn't as good as Fifty Shades (not in content or fluidity).  It seemed to be a lot going on in the book, but with no conclusions (spoiler alert).  I really didn't care for Eva and all of her worrying, seemed unnecssary when Gideon was written to be the type of man that took care of business.  I also didn't care for the constant repeating how they were each other's soulmates and could just read each other without speaking words.  Not saying that those relationships don't exist it just seemed to be filler that wasn't really necessary.  I thought, ok I get it they were made for each other. I guess I can conclude my review by saying if you got through the first two books, you can get through this one, but I can't say you'll be satisfied with the ending or that you'd purchase a fourth book...., I thought this was a great love story, but also a great story about a woman recovering from and overcoming an abusive relationship.  As I read, I thought women really go through this type of abuse and it was good to read a story where the woman was able to break free and eventually live a god life.  I thought the movie should have stayed true to the book to show her strength and selflessness in the face of danger.\\n\\nI do think Julianne Hough was a good choice actress based on the character in the book and of course, you can never go wrong with Josh Duhamel., Authentic romance...\\n\\nCharacters are well developed and every storyline makes sense. Nothing is really over the top. The one thing I would have liked better is if Jocelyn was a little older. Braden is a true alpha male and just the thought of him made me want to take a trip!\\n\\nThis actually wasn't my first time reading this book, but it was still really good and kept my interest!, I won't rate all three novels because review will about sum it up.  I understand the Fifty Shades sparked a huge interest in the world of BDSM and that authors are going to try to capitalize on it, but come on can you have an original story line at least.  This book is a complete parallelism of Fifty Shades of Grey with different character names and slight variations.  Oh yeah, and the author throws in a male supposed best friend/protector that is way to free with personal information.  Well, I finished the series because I purchased it but there was really no need because I'd already read Fifty Shades., Sweet romance...who doesn't love a heroic firefighter. Megan was a little neurotic and Summer seemed too mature and cunning to be seven, but overall a good read...predictable, but still worth it., Funny, quick read and it was free! It being free set aside, I enjoyed Anna's journey to self realization and self worth., Fast, fun read and a cute romance.  Of course, it's predictable but a good read all the same.  If you're into novellas this would be a good story for you to read.  If you need more substance in your romances you probably want to choose something else., Where to begin...sometimes I like the secret baby angle, but in this one not so much. I couldn't get pass, maybe, chapter four. First, there are lots of typos. Second, I couldn't tell which era this book was supposed to set in. I hate books that are supposed to be set in modern times, but the dialogue (and judgement is from a different time). I understand having morals and values, but ruined at 23 for having a child out of wedlock, not so much. That brings me so my third issue with the book, is the heroine 23 and the hero 32, that puts him at 28 when she was 18, practically still a child! Definitely, never like that angle. I prefer mature adults in my romance novels. I didn't get to what actually happened in their initial interlude, but I bet she was a virgin...blah! Lastly, the mom is a snob, a hot mess snob. The two dads in the novel are the only characters that made me want to continue reading, but Im sure they're parts aren't big enough to make this novel worth reading., I couldn't wait to be done with this series! I don't think I've ever actually hated a female lead character but this supposed 26 yr old worked my nerves! She seemed more like a 15 yr old hormonal, psychotic or neurotic, petulant, bratty and spoiled girl! I'm not familiar with obsessive disorders, but I don't believe any grown man would deal that hypocritical and crazy behavior!\\n\\nThe first book was free so I gave it a try! I'm the type that has to finish a series! Anyway, book two was oversexed! It was like one line...sex scene! The entire relationship was physical and then next thing they're throwing around the \"L\"!\\n\\nI just really could have done without Alayna! Hudson kept me interested!, A really good read! Although it was predictable I still enjoyed the journey! Absolutely loved Ben! Peaked my interest in bearded men!, Loved Chase. Of course it was a predictable story, but I still enjoyed reading it. A good start to the Gamble Brother series., A rip off of Fifty Shades. Also, small little things like not knowing some medicines effect your birth control didn't seem realistic. And I also thought it was really repetitive., I read the first in the Blackstone Affair series rather quickly and was checking the Internet daily for the release of part 2...very disappointing.  It seemed rather redundant and I don't think she wrote from a man's perspective very well...., What can I say? There's just so much to love about Jake in this book. He's all alpha, but he's emotional and expressive. Tru is okay too. I hate her ups and downs and insecurities, but Jake makes it better and bearable.\\n\\nStill some grammatical issues, but definitely worth a read.\\n\\nLastly, I've read this book more than once and I'd recommend if you haven't seen Walk Line to check it out. Jake and Tru really are like Johnny Cash and Jun!, Predictable, but still a good read. Not overly obscene, but theres some heat if you need that in your romance novels.\\n\\nPart of a series, but can be read alone., I really couldn't pronounce the name Bronwyn so that sometimes messed up the flow of reading, but otherwise it was a great book about endurance and working through your problems...fighting for what you want., I understand that when you have a formula that works and your readers respond that you don't want to deviate from it, but really this book is exactly the same as Crazy For Her.\\n\\nWoman in trouble...ex-SEAL to the rescue.\\n\\nEx-SEAL wants girl, but feels he doesn't deserve!  He's resisting!\\n\\nMore mommy issues.\\n\\nOh no another kidnapping! By the way the kidnapping in Crazy For Her had a better storyline than this kidnapping!\\n\\nA rescue, some caveman stuff, an engagement!  Surprise, surprise!\\n\\nI liked Jake and Maria was ok, but I wish I didn't feel like I read the same exact book with slight changes!, Almost any book with hot Navy SEALS in it is a win, but I really liked the storyline and the relationship and chemistry between the characters.\\n\\nI don't know what else to say without giving up the book, but I'd definitely recommend this as a great romance and not lacking in the steamy!, This one was a sexy read. It was dark in some places! Nico was definitely all alpha male. The only thing I didn't like was that it was so much drama. It was like one thing after another and considering the drama started at the very beginning I don't even know how they stayed together. Also don't know about the love at first sight....more like lust at first sight.]   \n",

I am happy that I did, it's a wonderful book.  Well written and a heartfull story.  One weekend to revisit the past, to put it really in the past and be able to look forward.  A father, a son and a grandfather that finally are able to really speak to each other with the truth., This book was a surprise, a good one.  It's a very pleasant read, the characters are lovable and I had a good time reading it. You will have a good time with it at the beach or in the winter near the hearth with a cup of tea.  It's a very positive book without being sanctimonious., This was the only book I hadn't read by Ms Canham and I was lucky that it was reissued on Kindle.  I loved it as all her other books before.  The characters are three dimensional, real people and not perfect at all.  The only thing to say about this book is that I would have liked the end to be less abrupt.  I think the characters needed more time to resolve their issues but other than that you will have the time of your life reading it.  It's a perfect book to read on an icy evening near the fire with a cup of tea or a glass of wine.  Have fun!, I loved all Amanda Stevens' books. This is no exception. It is a very good story, very well written. The characters are interesting and well developed BUT the ending of the book left me wanting more. It felt rushed, it left too many strings not attached. I don't want to bring spoilers here so lets only say that a few. Ore pages or an epilogue would have left me satisfied. As a reader, after reading all this book I needed closure, as well as the characters in the book, well I consider that I didn't have it. Nevertheless this is a book worth reading. I'm giving it 3 and a half stars., I couldn't finish this book.  Usually I like romances and I don't have a problem with Christian books when they don't hit you on the head with Jesus. This book was BORING, boring.  I can't understand all the 5 stars reviews.  At least it was free.  I don't like to write a bad review but I think I owe it to the next reader., Some of the reviewers disliked the H and the h. I think they didn't read the story the same way as others. The characters were true to their personalities and their background experiences. I liked the plot, the development and the characters.  I think the writer did a very good job on this story. I would recommend this book to my friends., Although this story is predictable it is not bad.  The ending is a bit abrupt and sometimes it feels like the characters aren't really in the story but it is a nice reading., I had this book for free and that is why I decided to try it because I didn't know the author. The idea is very nice and the plot is interesting but... and I think this is important, there are so many mistakes, typos, grammar, tense mistakes that the book losses credibility. Ms Connors should invest in an editor to help improve a book that have a big potential but losses it in the way. Maybe also polish some parts. It's really a pity to leave it like this., Michael Hicks strikes again!  Another interesting book.  When you read this you know that many of the things told in this story are true.  The GMO have been among us for some years now and the big corporations are the ones testing them and saying that they are safe and many of the executives of this corporations are now members of the government that aprove them.  The same can be said about pharmaceutical companies which are also connected to the ones fabricating the GMO seeds.  And the only thing that Mr Hicks took from fantasy is the alien conspiracy.  So yes, I think this is well thought and I liked a lot the way he tells this story.  And the characters are human and imperfect.  It's a nice book to take on vacation or at home for a rainy weekend or for reading on your patio under the sun.  But read it!, The final chapter of the IN HER NAME series is an amazing conclusion.  Sometimes during the reading I asked myself how the narrator could find a solution for the difficult knots in the plot but there was always a wonderful surprise ahead.  At times I was drying a tear here and there also.  This series is a succesful mixing of Bible stories (David and Goliath, Redemption), fairy tales (Sleeping Beauty),Shakespeare (Romeo and Juliet), Greek stories (the Amazons, the Spartans).  Mr Hicks is a real storyteller and he can tell a story with the best of them.  Even if usually you don't like SciFi (it's my case) you should read this book.  It's worth it!, This is the second installement in the IN HER NAME series an as the first book is an amazing story.  Mr. Hicks is a very talented writer and his characters are real people, with virtues and flaws.  The hero, Reza is not perfect but he is a wonderful person and the secondary characters are so interesting, they really enrich the story.  As I said in my comment of the first book I am not a SciFi reader but this series is THE exception for me. So, the conclusion is if you like fantasy, adventure, thriller, romance and evidently SciFi this book is for you., I could download this book for free during the ebook week.  Usually I don't read SciFi but it was free so I tried it because it had good comments.  I am so happy to have had the opportunity to read it!  It was a big and happy surprise!  I loved it, I couldn't put it down.  It's really very well written. The characters are alive and they engaged you from the first page in their adventures.  It's SciFi because of the environment but it's a solid novel.  Even if SciFi is not your cup of tea try this book it's worth it., As the other one star reviewer I can't understand the 5 stars given to this book.  It is very badly written, the characters are ditched by their fianc and lover and instead of being at least a bit sad they are attracted to each other instantly.  They were supposed to be in love with their respective lovers.  The heroine is this hotshot investor but she seemed so immature that I couldn't believe she was \"real\". Finally, I gave up and leave it because even if I bought it for only one dollar I considered I was wasting my time., Shelley Thacker puts magic in her books. The characters become alive between her fingers. In this book I laughed, I cried and I cheered for them. As in most of her books the plot is not as important as the characters, they are the ones that pull you in. I definitely recommend this book and I am waiting for the next one., Another great book in the series! Thacker never dissapoints. I have a new job and much less time to read but this book? I assure you once I began I couldn't stop, i read during my lunch time. At home the housework had to wait and the book took first place. It is sweet, hot has adventure, romance. Do you a favor and read it!, What a great story! I was a bit reluctant because of the subject, it's easy to turn it into something cheesy and ridiculous. But Ms Thacker did a wonderful job giving life to it.  It's credible, romantic, adventurous and I had a great time reading it. The characters follow a logical way to react given the circumstances, the sex scenes are really romantic and tasteful. I have also read her trilogy Stolen Brides, that I loved and I am happy not to be dissapointed. So if you like romances where the H and h have had a difficult begining in life, this is for you.\\nAnd after writing this review I've just bought AFTER SUNDOWN, the latest book.:), I won't summarize the story because some of the reviewers have already done it and very well.\\nFor me this is a new writer, it was the first time I read one of her books and I wasn't expecting much.  But I received a big surprise! The cover is not the best I've seen but OMG the story inside is one of the best I've read in a long time and it will stay one of my favorites of all times with the second book in this series.  The characters are endearing and real people with flaws.  There is one person here that gave this book one star based on the idea that the hero cheated on the heroine.  I think she haven't read the book at all because it is completely clear that the heroine thinks that the hero cheated on her and the operative word here is \"think\".  I almost didn't buy the book based on that review so do it yourself a favor and if you like time travel romances and very sweet stories with characters that are not perfect then read this book and you won't regret it., If possible this book is even better that the first one of the series.  The story and the characters are very endearing.  I am waiting impatiently for the third book.  I will add Ms. Thacker to my list of favorite writers and wait for other wonderful stories. I liked that this story was so different from FOREVER HIS and once I began reading I coudn't put the book down and it made me daydream.  It is a very sweet romance., I liked this story very much as the others I've read by ms Thacker. She doesn't disappoint in this book. If you liked the other two in the series you will love this one. A romance with w twist of the fantastic with no big surprises but very nice and true., I love the stories written by Elisabeth Naughton and this one didn't disappoint. The first part of the story is very hot and sexy but then you receive a punch on the gut with the secrets both characters are keaping from each other and that is what I love about her books, the characters are not some beautiful empty puppets but people with difficult past lives that put one foot in front of the other and kept going. So this book is short but powerful. I loved it, I love fairy tales so I began reading this book with great expectations but when I was about 25% into the book I was so bored that I couldn't continue reading.  The characters were boring and nothing happened in the first part of the book.  The heroine kept repeating that she found the heroe attractive but I couldn't really feel it. It felt forced. So sorry that the story didn't deliverd what it promised., This was a great reading.  Very well written with good characters this book was very difficult to put aside so I read it very fast.  It has a Christian tone but it is not invasive and it mesh well with the story.  Usually I don't like Christian fiction for its proselitism but this book don't really qualify as Christian fiction. It is a moving story of forgiveness and acceptance of the things we cannot change., I couldn't read more than 3 chapters.  It bored me so much.  It could be an interesting plot but something went wrong.  I think the talent to write wasn't in this book.  Sorry., This book has a great story to tell.  I fell instantly in love with Cassie and Grey.  Cassie is a very strong heroine who had to survive some very difficult situations and Grey became strong through the ordeal of being imprisoned for 10 years in solitary. Both of them have great strength of character, can empathise with others misery but they have also a sense of inadequacy and are spiritually wounded.  I could feel the connection between Cassie and Grey, the story is beautifully written and develops smoothly.  So, if you like a love story with a good adventure plot and with H/h not perfect, this a book that you will love., This a very different paranormal. I loved all the books on this series. You have romance, adventure and suspense.  The storyline works very well and the characters play their roles naturally with fluent dialog. If you are into paranormals you shlud like this series, Another terrific book by Teresa Medeiros. I liked this book much more than The Temptation of your Kiss. The hero is an engaging character, sweet and with a great sense of humor. The descriptions in this gothic are perfect and there is a combination of gothic air with the humor that characterises Medeiros novels. For those who have read  A Sicilian Romance you will find some touches there and one of the characters is reading TSR, I think this was a great touch. So I greatly recommend this book., I am a Medeiros fan and this book is one of her best.  It is not your ordinary romance:  beautiful heroine  meet gorgeous hero and blam! they fall in lust or love.  This is the story about two lonely people, each with some bagage (who hasn't have one?) and how they connect using Twitter.  How all began with superficial exchange and slowly they tell each other their secrets.  I laughed, I cried and in the end I was left wanting more but it is the end that it had to have for this story.  Ms Medeiros chose well.  I couldn't put it down.  Read it it's worth it., This is a very enjoyable story, sweet and entertaining.  It's my first Tina Folsom and I had it free for my Kindle and now I bought the second and third book from this series.  I really liked it and if you like vampires that are not perfect (this is a series where the vampires are a little different from the usual vampire hero) you will like this book., This second instalment was somewhat not as good as the first one but was worth reading. It felt like a repetition of the first one. But I am reading the third, Dying for a Daiquiri and am loving it!  So even if it is not great I repeat it is worth reading it. I liked the characters very much and the humour in the book feels natural not forced as in many books I've read in the past, It was a cute book, easy to read and I had an agreable moment reading it.  It's a book to read when you need to cheer up, on the beach, in the sun or you want to have a light read. Nothing extraordinary but not bad. The characters are pleasant, amusing and the fantasy world entertains. Somebody said that there were a lot of typos and grammar mistakes; I saw some but nothing that could distract from the story., I liked it but it wasn't a great book.  I don't know what it was that didn't do it for me.  The idea of the story was what catch me first, it made me think about Beauty and the Beast which is my favourite fairy tale.  So that is why I bought it. But there was something artificial in the atraction Maya felt for Gabriel. Don't think it is a bad story.  I found it entertaining and I read it very fast because it caught me but when I finished it it left me with the feeling that something was missing., One of the reviews said that maybe one of the older crowd would like it but nooooo.  I am one of the older crowd and this was boring.  The characters are boring, the writing is boring and the dialog is extremely boring.  It was free and I thought the theme would be interesting but no.  I couldn't finish it and believe me I tried., This book was a very nice surprise.  I downloaded it when it was free and I wasn't expecting something so good.  It's very well written, very witty and a romance that doesn't walk on the main road.  I had fun with it but also it made me think.\\nVery interesting and fun reading., This story reads as a typical romance but it has something that makes it interesting and keeps you reading.  There is some spice in it that took me on the ride.  There are some grammar mistakes and typos that could be easily corrected but nothing that will take you off the story.  At the end of the book though the things became a little too mushy and improbable trying to open book 2 and 3 of the series. But as my title says this author has potential and as this is, I think, a first book I will keep an eye on her and read her next books., I liked this first book very much but it needs some serious professional editing.  I think that the author will gain a lot to give this book to a professional editor and work with him/her because this is a book that has great potential.  I was really distracted by the bad grammar, the \"you're and your\", \"then and than\",  the change from past to present  tense in the same sentence, etc.  There were words and expressions wrongly used too.\\nIt reads at first a bit like a feminine Harry Potter crossed with Twilight.  There is some likeness to it.  Eden is an orphan who doesn't know she has magic and she was raised by her aunt. She is \"persecuted\" by a powerful and malevolent king and her grandfather \"concealed\" her to protect her (a bit like Dumbledore with Harry).  And there are some other elements like these but at some time the story takes off and it is really good.\\nI was hooked and bought the second and third book in this series.  It is really worth reading if you like fantasy, despite the bad grammar.\\nAs I said in the title the story is 5 stars but because of the grammar problems I can't give them., I received this book in exchange for an honest review.\\nThe story is a romance with a tiny bit of a mistery in the plot but mistery is definitely not the important part of the story. The beginning is slow but not bad.\\nH and h had had a relationship when they were teens that ended abruptly and badly. Now ten years later they end together at the place where all began when the father's H dies in an accident.\\nWhat I didn't like:\\n- this book needs proofreading, there are a number of errors that are really distracting, from sentence structure, typos to misplaced words.\\n- when finally the action begins, the way the things are presented are not interesting. Fr exemple, it would have been nice to explain the process of the research done to find evidence by the h. Instead all was presented as a fait accompli.\\n- the characters where not fully developed and sometimes the dialogues were a bit artificial.\\nMaybe if a good editor were to be given this book, something could come out of it., I've read 48% and i am thinking about abandoning it. I've really tried to finish it because the premise is interesting but, is this really happening in a college and the heroine is a 20 year old woman? She seems like 15 in high school.  The writing and grammar are not great either, there are many mistakes in each page. I think it would have been better to put the characters in a high school and give the book to an editor. So my two stars are because of the good premise without that it would had been a one star review., Nice story line. Made me smile and sometimes even laugh. It's the kind of book to read when you need something light to read. I've bought book number two of the series, Dying for a Dance and I am reading it., It's the third installment in this series and very good. I liked it better than the second one, Dying for a Dance. The action was in Hawaii with new characters added to the usual ones, the heroine brother and his wife and the decor was fabulous. So now I am waiting for the fourth one that I am sure I'm going to read., great book. a real page turner, Another exciting story!  After nine books Genevive and her team are  still going at it in a great way. I absolutely loved this story and am now waiting for the next one where I imagine we will have more about Vinnie. In this book we had a bit of Vinnie's past, how he got his scar.  The plot was exciting and convoluted but precise too. You can read the book alone but it would loose a big chunk of charm. You can have a look in the characters minds if you read all of them in order. This is one of the best series I've read., This is a romantic book with a lot of action.  So if you don't like romantic books don't read it.  But if you like a good romance but with something else, this book is for you.  The characters are well defined and very likable, the plot is well written and developed.  In two words, an enjoyable book., It was my first book by this author and I had it as a freebie so I didn't expect much but I was surprised when it resulted a surprisingly excellent romance.  The characters are lovable, the story is very sweet and I was laughing sometimes.\\nSPOILER ALERT!\\nThe only thing I didn't like was the storyline about David's dad and his wife and Daphne having arranged all the \"thing\" between Sophie and David. It wrung false and strange.  But it was a minor thing compared with the quality of the storytelling.  I will try other books by this author, definitely., Usually I am not a fan of Civil War romances but I decided to try this one because of all the five star reviews and the fact that the author contacted me by Facebook and I found her posts funny or interesting. So Here I were reading this story and let me tell you I loved every minute of it.  The characters are uber interesting and they interact in a natural way.  After having a chain of awful book reading this one was refreshing, I couldn't find even one grammar mistake.  Heaven!!! I know that this should be the normal thing but trust me, it is not. Nowadays books are filled with them and I think it is a way to tell the readers:  I don't respect you!  So this book has great grammar ;o), a great love story to tell mixed with history.  Then, a great combination.  And last but not least a great way of telling it., This is a very compelling thriller. I read it in one sit because I couldn't put it down. At the same time I have to say that it has explicit violence and at times it was difficult to read because of it but that it's just me. At the beginning of the story it feels a bit twitchy but it gets better after some pages. It is a good mystery and IMO it is worth reading., Again as I said about book one of these series the grammar is awful and the author has to hire a professional editor ASAP and there are some inconsistencies that need also to be sorted out. Only as an example, the underage characters order wine at a restaurant and nobody finds this strange.  As I understand in the States 16 or 17 is underage for alcohol consumption so I think that some explanation or change should be made here.  And the countless mistakes take away a big part of the quality of the book.\\nI've found this book better even than the first one but, and this is for Ms Higginson: I pray you, give your book to a professional editor.  You have a good book in your hands that could be great.\\nI loved this book and I am now reading the third one.  If you like fantasy, make yourself a favor and read these series., I loved this book. This is an outstanding story and different from any lo e story I 've read. Very well executed. The characters are alive and well developped. I recommend this book. It's been a long time since I gave a five star review., Shelly Thacker is one of my favorite romance authors and this book made me like her even more, if possible.\\nIt has it all: a fabulous plot wonderfully developped, damaged and mistrustful characters -- a hero who is a man with a difficult past and a heroine who suffered a lot- and great secondary characters who are worth their own book.\\nIt's an impressively well-written book. The description and dialogues flow so easily that you fall into the story from the first page. The love scenes are not only HOT but sweet and romantic.\\nAnd I loved the adventure that kept me on the edge of my seat! So do it yourself a favor and read it!, After 8 years Ms Canham is back with all guns out.  I always loved her books but after so much time without writing I didn't know what to expect.  But she is as great as always.  I absolutely loved Gabriel's and Evangeline's story.  This is a book that you must absolutely read if you like pirates, treasure hunting, adventure and evidently romance.  The characters are endearing and true, the adventure is engrossing and the romance is sweet and hot., I loved every one of the books in this series and the number 8 is no exception. It was a roller coaster and i couldn't put it down.  The characters endeared themselves even more in this book and OMG, the end is a wonderful cliff-hanger and now I don't know how I will survive the waiting for the next book.  I have to know what happens to Clarissa and how the \"angel\" that finds her will help her. I can't say more without spoiling the story for you. The books in this series keep becoming better and better.\\nThe only negative thing I have to say about this book is that there are still some problems with the grammar, YOU'RE vs. YOUR, to name one.  There are not a lot of them but still some must have run from the editor.  This in no way deter from the quality of the story but I think that it is something that could be corrected and give a better impression of the book., Awesome.\\n\\nPlenty of action.  I was astonished turning the pages.  I didn't know Ms Ryan was so good for action!  Quite a move.  Always delightful.  Thank you for the good book, yes. Once again., Sometimes when you have a perfect series you have to let it go at some point. The first ten books of this series were very good, I liked them very much. But this one fell short of the others. It felt like there was nothing new to tell so the situations were rigid and didn't feel right. The mystery wasn't really a mystery, you could see it right there. The best thing would have been to continue with Sean story, a really NEW mystery. I am sorry to give a bad review but I would like to give my opinion to other possible readers of this book. I think that Terri Reid is capable of better than this., Don't search for reality in this book.  I loved it as an escapist story and it made me sigh in pleasure.  This is a great book to read when you are on a vacation to escape reality and inmerse you in a great fantasy. It is a very sweet story, well written and it made me daydream. The characters,principal or secondary, are dears and engaging.  For me this author is new and now I am buying the next one in this series because I absolutely want to know Joe story. I highly recommend this book., I received a ARC copy in exchange of an honest review.\\nI am not going to write a blurb of the story as many of the reviewers alredeady did it. It gripped me from page one. The story is engaging with very well rounded characters that give you a wonderful ride through the storyline. It is a great story, very well written that will give you some wonderful hours of reading. Treat yourself and read it!, Sorry, but I couldn't read more than 8% of this book.  I was so bored I had to stop.  The characters did nothing for me nor the story., I loved this book.  It has great characters, good plots and humour.  The four stories are really good but the last one \"Second best\" touched my heart like not a book in a long time have.  This is a book that I would bring with me to a desert island and reread many times.  Wonderful and touching are the two words that come to my mind to describe it., I loved this book. It surprised me although it is not easy to do so in a mystery. Francis Bacon was a philosopher in the Elizabethan era and here he comes to life in a different situation. And why not? We have a story based on a real person and it makes a great character., I had this book for free because usually I don't read this kind of book.  The story was imaginative and great but I think it could be better with a bit of editing.  Some parts drag on and on and the parts where Ash think about Cathy's and Katrina's destiny are repetitive.  The begining is a bit slow but once you read 1/3 of the book the story begins to be really interesting., I loved this book! I liked to read one of my favourite fairytales in an adult version. If you like fairytales this book is for you., This is the story of an innocent young girl who falls in love and lust with an \"old\" man.  In the story the old man is only 41 or 42 but is presented as an old fat man.  The young girl is 18 and in a day she falls in love with him because he is very kind to her.\\nThe situation is not really plausible and the dialogues seemed forced to me.\\nI continued reading, because I forced myself to do it, about 75% of the book but I couldn't continue with it.\\nGael is a really nice man but please, to make us believe that an 18 year old girl will fall in love with him so fast and not only in love but in lust (she wanted to \"really\" be his wife) the narrator should have given us something more, more time or more drama or something.\\nAnd I am not the kind of person who needs fiction to be \"real\" but it has to be plausible in the situation of the book, the plot, the time line, again something.\\nI bought this book because of the title and the sample but was very disappointed.\\nI gave it two stars and not one only because the book has some good points, the atmosphere, the idea of the plot., I don't read short stories anymore, why? because there aren't many good ones out there! But here we have an exemple of very well written ones.  IMO to write a good short story is more difficult than to write a good novel. In a short number of pages the narrator have to achieve the difficult task of a good plot, define the characters, good descriptions and to catch the attention of the reader.  Here Ms Scott Taylor succeded to do it all. Even if I didn't love everyone of the stories I must say that they are all very well written.]   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             [This coat is a great deal.  Good craftsmanship, nice sturdy fabric.  The details - cinched waist, hood toggles, zippers, and lined pockets really make the jacket look nice.  True to size - I ordered a large - I am 5-8, 145.  Arms are a bit snug when wearing a sweater underneath.  This coat is a steal at the current price of under $30., This dress is adorable, but runs a bit small.  My 4 .5 year old daughter was too big for a size 5, and she sent super large or heavy for her age.  Pattern is nice though, and the detail around the neck is cute., I have been using these for about a month and a half, and have been happy with their performance.  No leaking.  They do fog up about every 10 minutes, but a quick rinse clears them out.  I have not tried to adjust the bridge pieces which came with the goggles.  I was worried that the pink tint of the lenses would be annoying, but it's not bad at all.  These stay put through lap swimming, and are not so tight that they leave horrible marks around my eyes post-swim.  I have not worn them while diving into the pool - so I can't recommend how they would fair for competition., Runs small - my 60 lb son who is skinny as a rail couldn't get into it, and we are used to hearing life jackets.  Otherwise, a quality made perfectly decent life jacket., Good quality but runs small.  My daughter weighs 40 lbs and has a 23 inch chest, so she us well within guidelines for the child vest, however this was super tight on her.  Otherwise good quality life jacket., TI bought these for my son for batting practice and catch.  These have been fine for practice, and hold up well.  They are a soft core and much bouncier than a true baseball.  We use them for batting, so that is fine.  For fielding practice, they are just okay, as they don't mimic a true base ball - again, the bounciness.  I would recommend them for kids who are still earning to catch, because they are soft., Fits my thick legged 2.5 year old great, she is about 24lbs.  The fit is snug without chaffing.  It looks like a bikini breif bottom.  The fabric is loose, but the legs and waist are tight enough to contain any accidents (Though we have not tested this yet..!)\\nIt seems to be holding up well after multiple cold water/gentle washes in the washing machine., Well made, color is true to online image.  There are pencil keeper pockets sewn into in the small front pocket.  Double zipper on the large opening.  Functional and stylish., This sleeping bag appears to be really well made.  We washed it, per the instructions and the batting stayed in place. The liner is super soft.  The bag comes completely apart into two separate pieces for washing.  It comes with a compression sack.  Weight is about 15 lbs, and it is HUGE.  definitely for car camping, not backpacking., This suit had a matte finish that I was not fond of.  Like most competitive type suits it is very tight.  Support was decent and the suit appears to be well made, but I ended up returning the suit.  It is definitely a skimpier fit than many lap suits but was flattering., Very well made.  Easy to adjust straps.  Comfortable, but takes a while to dry.  I think we'll get several summers out of this vest.  Fit my tall and skinny 9 year old well., good quality and excellent price for youth soccer ball.  The color has faded, but the ball is holding up well., I ws pleasantly surprised with the quality of this product.  We ordered the purple leotard with flutter sleeves.  It is true to size and well constructed.  I would buy more products from this company., We've bought several of these t shirts now, they are well made and affordable.  Seller ships promptly (mine were not prime) and will give you a shipping discount for multiple items (as in you are not charged the full shipping price for each item if you buy a bunch all at once.), Bought these for warm up batting practice before our minors team games.  One fo the balls is already split after 1 day of use.  They are $2-3 cheaper per dozen than our local sporting goods store, not sure if the quality is better or not.  They are regulation baseball size., Well made life vest.  Fit my 6 year old 40 lb child well.  Lots of room to expand sizing.  Neoprene is more comfortable than the standard itchy block foam with nylon cover.  Only issue is that they take a while to dry., Unhappy with this coconut oil - off odor, off color.  I have purchased many different brands and refinement levels, but have not encountered one with a smell like this.  it just smells old and a little rancid, nit the sweet fresh coconut smell of other oils.  I'm bummed because Spectrum usually does a great job.\\nAlso, this doesn't say it is edible anywhere on the packaging.  OF COURSE COCONUT OIL IS EDIBLE - BUT Normally oils processed for human consumption rather than skincare/beauty say so on the packaging.  And oils processed for consumption are subject to different regulations for processing cleanliness, safety standards, etc.  This doesn't talk about the heat level it can beed on in cooking, or mention cooking or eating with it.  But it's sold in the food category.  I would be interested to see what Spectrum has to say about this.  Bottom line, I would not purchase again., These came with only about a month left before they all expired.  So they were not super fresh, and now we have to eat 6 boxes on 2 months, which was not the plan.  I would not order again.\\nThis is an Amazon inventory issue, not a critique of the taste of the bars when they are actually fresh., I bought these to round out a SnS order.  The cookies tasted good, and were in two smaller packages within the box.  Sadly about half the cookies were broken.  (fine for eating, not great presentation.  I think this could have happened in transit)\\nFlavor is good though!  Buttery, fresh, crisp.  Much thinner than Walkers., I didn't realize it, but this flavor has the bottom dipped in frosting/caramel flavor, which tastes good, but makes a big mealy mess.  the flavor was good, but this box tasted a little stale.  I prefer the maple pecan, which don't have the dipping, just a slightly sweet flavor., I love that these are not too sugary, but still taste great.  Also, no melting like the chocolate varieties.  BTW - there is nothing \"spicy about these, they are just a light vanilla flavor., I didn't realize it, but this flavor has the bottom dipped in frosting/caramel flavor, which tastes good, but makes a big mealy mess.  the flavor was good, but this box tasted a little stale.  I prefer the maple pecan, which don't have the dipping, just a slightly sweet flavor., I love that these are not too sugary, but still taste great.  Also, no melting like the chocolate varieties.  BTW - there is nothing \"spicy about these, they are just a light vanilla flavor., These do the job for a quick caffine fix. Not too acidic.  (no sad coffee belly).  They are alittle sweeter than I'd like, (Like 2 sugar packets).\\n But the cream level is just right.\\nYOU must have them chilled., I didn't realize it, but this flavor has the bottom dipped in frosting/caramel flavor, which tastes good, but makes a big mealy mess.  the flavor was good, but this box tasted a little stale.  I prefer the maple pecan, which don't have the dipping, just a slightly sweet flavor., I love that these are not too sugary, but still taste great.  Also, no melting like the chocolate varieties.

BTW - there is nothing \"spicy about these, they are just a light vanilla flavor., My kids love these books, they are spooky without being scary.  The characters are relatable.  Good for grade 1-2 depending on the kids reading level.  My third grade son can read through one of these in an afternoon, but still likes the stories., My son was able to put the hammock stand together in about 15 minutes.  It is comfortable and compact.  I know it is called a double hammock, however two adults is a tight fit.  You really could pack it up in the carrying case and take it camping, etc.  Cotton fabric is as shown and the adjustable hooks are a nice feature.\\nThe only flaw we have found is that the back side of the adjustable hooks can actually rub on the fabric of the hammock if you are laying far to one end or the other.  I think that eventually this could cause rips/holes, but you could either cover the bolts or just be aware of where you'r laying on the hammock.  This is not a deal breaker for us at all.  Overall, good construction and a great buy., Table and chairs came fully assembled and ready for use.  They are not as sturdy as other similar sets with a higher price that I have seen in person, but I believe these will hold up fine.  My issues was with the paint.  It was scratched off in several places on the chairs, and you can see there is no base coat/primer, so I wonder how long the finish will last.  There are also a couple small spots where the paint doesn't cover the metal at all.  Likley we will have to repaint them in a year or two., Easy to install and has worked with heavy use for 3 months.  For the price, this faucet is great.  it does feel a little light weight, however, you can't tell by looking at it.  No leeks!, A fun toy.  Chest is a nice size for a 6-8 year old to carry around.  maybe a foot print of 12x8 inches?  The clasp works well, and the false floor was fun for my kids to discover.  The coins are a little cheap looking, but fine for play.  Some people have commented that the finish on the box is not as pictured, but mine is very close., These are good quality markers.  Note that they are SMALL!  Pip Squeaks, as in little.  Each marker is only about 4 inches long with the cap on.  So about 1/2 the size of the regular skinny Crayola markers.  Obviously they have less ink than a standard carrel marker.  But, we bought these to take on vacation, so the smaller size was perfect for travel.  There are 64 markers in the box, and it says that there are 64 distinct colors.  I have to say that several of them look identical on paper, even though the cap colors are different.  Overall, a good marker for a good price, and I am happy with the purchase.  I would buy again., Mi kids love this game, it is fun and easy to play.  put the tree together, thread the sticks through the holes, drop in the monkeys.  They will play for a good hour or so, fun for adults too.  My only complaint is that it's kind of hard to get the two sides of the palm tree to snap together.  Also, the stick are sharp on the ends, not for kids under three unless COMPLETELY supervised., This was a gift, but our family friend said her two boys - ages 7 and 9 love them.  They shoot far and have not yet broken any wndows with them...  So just wild enough for good times., My kids love the Playmobil brand.  The details are great, and for being so small, the items are quite durable.  This set includes everything pictured, a great start to a \"farm\" or a stand alone play item.  If you child still puts things in their mouth, beware - there are small parts!, These are huge and silly, perfect for kids.  They are clearly plastic, but a nice heavy weight.  We recieved a variety of colors, but no rubies, sadly., These are well made little cards and perfect for toddlers, soft and cloth covered, you can wipe them clean.  The wheels roll surprisingly well.  They come in a little semi-disposable case, which makes toting them along easy., Nice idea, but the tops of the eggs come off at the slightest touch, so the ink has dried out, and I keep finding either a stamp, or an ink pad in random places.  If they stayed closed, I'd give it 5 stars..., I like the idea, but this isn't very well conceived.  Ariel can't stand up, and it's hard to make the bottom of her\"dress\" stick to her waist.  Her chariot is okay, but again, she ca't really stay upright in it very well.  The extruder tool was not super is kind of difficult for my 4 year old to operate.  Play-Doh was fresh, and the colors were fun.  This is fun, but I probably would not purchase this item again., These are the mini tubs - other than that, good color selection, very fresh and reasonable priced., Per other reviewers, the perfume bottle did not work for us.  Also, it makes a giant mess.  The bottle doesn't make a puff of moisture, it makes a stream of water.  That being said, the doll has been a hit and the perfume bottle has become a bath toy.\\nSkirt comes off, the top is molded onto the body of the doll.  The hair is nice, and the crown is removable.  Good quality for the price., These are fun, but the metalic raised stickers seem to stick better to our hardwood floor than the plastic brebraceletts.  A fun project for kids 3-8.  Plenty of stickers.  One pack kept the kids busy for about a half hour, and they enjoyed playing dress up with them after the initial art project.  These would be a good party project., This is a fun kit, and my 8 year old was able to put it together fine.  But it doesn't stay together well.  I would say it is more for looking at than actually playing with., This is a fast and fun project.  East clean up and nice soaps.  the soap mold are really tiny though, definitely kid size or guest bathroom, lol.  We just did the basis soap the first time, but are excited to try out different additions like scented oils and herbs.  Soap is gentle on skin, very kid friendly., Two of the three color packs were the same, and they were all little firm - not sure fresh.  However, the kids were happy and the +/- $17 was a decent price with free Prime shipping., Perfect gift for an 18 month old.  She was able to pull the caterpillar and maneuver the blocks without a problem.  It is engaging and sturdy., This is a lot of legos.  Santa delivered these to our kids this Christmas, and they have played with them for hours. This is a great addition to existing sets, and also great for kids with imaginations - it doesn't come with instructions, you have to come up with your own designs.  Note, the box doesn't function as a storage box, you need a plastic bin or something to keep the legos in.\\nThere is a wide range of colors and shapes in this kit.  They are packaged by color in smaller bags inside the larger box.  I would recommend this product for lego lovers.  it is also more cost effective than buying smaller kits/boxes., Better quality than some of the barbie type dolls we have ordered.  The hair is nice and think, we are hoping it will hold up in the tub., My daughter loves this.  It really is like 10 feet long and about 18 inches wide.  There are perforations so you can rip it apart if needed, but we've left it long for coloring.  The crayons that come with it are not good, so plan on using your own, or purchasing them separately., This is nice flower press.  My 5 year old is able to use it on her own without assistance.  The wing nuts are a little tricky, but she can handle them.  We've done 3 or 4 bunches of flowers and ferns all with good results. You can use the paper between the cardboard presses again and again.  We have made than you cards and other art projects with the pressed flowers, For some reason the horse always comes unattached from the wagon.  Other than that, great fun.  The details of the buggy whip and harness are nice.  The wagon rolls well.  My 6 year old was able to assemble the set for his little sister., Good quality and cute.  Animals and tree arrived on time and as described.  They are \"beanie baby\" sized.  God for kids maybe 3-6?, These are good quality and arrived on time and as described.  The kit came with the little screw driver to take the wheels on and off.  I din't get the appeal of this particular toy, but my son and his friends love them., This is a very basic book, for ages 2-3.  My daughter enjoyed it., Introduces images and words for common household items and animals.  Pictures are bright and large.  Pages are sturdy and can take a beating.  I would recommend this book.  Lots to look at!, Easy to turn pages and big bright images.  Good for kids who want to look at \"real\" things.  1-2 years, but also good for beginning readers, matching image to the word., My kid will not put these books down.  Great for beginning chart books.  Mysterious without being scary or gross.  My second grader loves them., My 8 year old loves this book.  It is full of random facts with great images.  He has thanked us for it several times (This is uncommon, lol!)  Easy enough for him to read to his sister, who is 5 and enjoys looking at the pictures.  Great for the child who love to learn, and also is constantly asking questions - what is the fastest train?  Where is the hottest place on earth?  How long is an anaconda?  The list goes on..., This has some new, some old, all innocuous kids jokes.  I would say 10 and under will appreciate it the most.  This has been fun for my 8 and 5 year old., My husband used this to study (and pass) his contractors licence test.  He said it was helpful and will likely use it as a reference in the future., My kids love this book, the pictures are great.  It is true that there are very few words, you don't really need them.  It's mini people building a cake, super cute.  Good for ages 2-6, All of the A to Z Mysteries are good for early carport books.  Spooky and a little mysterious without being truly scary.  I can let my kids read them without worrying that there will be weird stuff in them., My kids love these books, they are spooky without being scary.  The characters are relatable.  Good for grade 1-2 depending on the kids reading level.  My third grade son can read through one of these in an afternoon, but still likes the stories., I think it's weird, but my eight year old enjoys this series.  Nothing too spooky, but excitement and adventure.  Think Clive Kussler for elementary school..., My son cannot put thee down.  They are exciting and spooky without being gross or scary.  James Bond meets Inspector Gadget with a dash of Ramona Quimby.  The sibling interaction is nice and believable.  The \"bad\" adults aren't too bad.  There is a little tiny bit of actual history involved.  I would recommend this book and the series.  I have been reading them along with my son.  They are not Pulitzer prize, but they are entertaining.]   \n",

really love this stuff.  In the long run it saves me money and time from stopping every morning for a mocha.

Coconut flavor is good, but could be a bit stronger., I had a more expensive charger before and it had a flashlight on it.  The button was constantly being turned by accident in my purse and when I needed it, it was dead.  Eventually it quit charging.  I like this one - simple and easy to use, not to mention about a 1/3 of the cost I paid for the one I got from QVC., Don't be an idiot like me and forget to take the clear plastic covering off of the inside and outside and complain to the company that it scratches......they told me, I looked, and they were right.  The only thing I didn't like is that it originally said the color was gold and then they changed it to honey almond...definitely not gold - kind of an ugly tan!  But well made!, Fits the iPhone 6 Plus perfectly., Really like this....except for the bright blue light illuminating from where the USB's plug in.....bad design for to use in a bedroom, unless you want a very bright night light.  But as for it's operation - works great!, I realize this was to keep your iPhone waterproof, but I wanted it to wear when I walk the dog and want to wear earbuds to listen to music or talk while I'm walking  and you can't close the top because it is suppose to seal tight - so it works very well....but I wish there was an option to put the earbud wire through., Very pretty, better than a lanyard for ID tags., much better than wearin ga lanyard - very nice and well made., Beautiful and very well made.

Ordered them for several months and then they were out of stock - Unfortunately they came back at almost twice the price that I originally paid for them.  They were only 8.97 a bag and now they are almost $15..  I will  probably continue to order until I find something equal in quality but cheaper in price - but now they only get one treat a day instead of two so I don't have to order as often.  Why such a price hike?, My kitty hates the shrimp one and not real thrilled with the snapper - not sure what the problem is with those choices.  I'll stick with the chicken and tuna flavors., Pedigree products have caused issues for our black lab. Used for years and in the past six months she's become extremely anxious, thirsty all the time, restless, gassy. Researched online and it seems pedigree was behind these issues in many dog's recently.  Pedigree canned has changed their recipe recently to homestyle and since then her gas issues have gotten much worse. Quit feeding pedigree for two weeks.

I love it., Owls are the big craze now and I collect solar motion toys.  This one is my favorite...much nicer than the ones you find in the dollar stores.  Worth the money., I really enjoyed this book. It's not the great American novel...but enough twist to keep you interested., So glad I picked this book as my Kindle First choice for December.  It was a very quick read and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  There are no chapters, but there are break points .  I usually tell myself one more chapter - and then I definitely have to go to sleep.....so this was a bit harder to put down.  The story is about a veteran who knows what he did was wrong and he just wants to fix it.  He can only really tell one person and he does it by writing to this person.  Of course, he knows the answer all along, but it isn't easy to undo something once it is done.  Fate has a way of taking over.  Don't hesitate, this is a very good book., A bit expensive since you have to provide the pillow - but i like the look and quality of the case., Beautifully written love story.  Try this new author - you will not be disappointed.]   \n",
       "883  [I usually don't like to mix themes.  I feel like if it's a romance let it be a romance or if it's a suspense let it be a suspense; however this book had the perfect amount of suspense and romance. It was a really good book and not easily predictable (at least not all parts).  I would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys historical romance novels!, BBW romances I've read. This one had subsistence and wasn't just about sex. I liked the story line. It was cute and sweet unlike that some of the other short stories that are more raunchy although this one gets sexy as well., I think the best part of a book is when the chemistry is written so well that the characters become real and you are rooting for them to work out.  I loved this book and can't say that there were any surprises.  Not that is was exactly predicatable, but from the Prologue you know to expect something.\\n\\nThe characters Jakes and Nina were well written and I definitely fell in love.  Jake was strong, a little bit dangerous and passionate.  he loved hard, cared thoroughly and entirely dedicated to Nina.  I loved his depth and the fact that he was truly an alpha male.  Nina for me was somewhat the typical female lead, but I liked that she was so jaded, but was very receptive to Jake.  It was a beautiful story and really demonstrated to me how when you do find your true soul mate, love can really conquer all., Was definitely a man you could easily fall in love with, but in my opinion Avery definitely didn't deserve him. Well written, good story and supporting cast, but it kind of dragged out in parts. Predictable in parts, but worth reading., With a powerful message and beautiful love story. I read this one before book 1, but it's kind of a spoiler if you do it in that order!\\n\\nLuke, Kayla and Eli....love them!, And although there were a lot of similarities to the other books, this was still a good and unique read.\\n\\nCan't wait for Micah and Tessa...., Even though I'm not really into the \"can't stand each other at first\" romance where there's so much hostility you're like where did you have time to fall in love, this was a pretty good read. I thought book one was overly dramatic, just one thing after another, but this one was a little less. Definitely recommend!, Caleb and Mira's story was written beautiful even though it was slightly dark.\\n\\nI really enjoy how this author writes shifter stories and the connection. Also, I love that she has heroines that you can love. They tend to be strong and admirable.\\n\\nNot overly sexual just a great story...., I read this is basically one sitting. I loved Dragon and Nic's story and can't wait to read how everything unfolds.\\n\\nThis book is super hot and sexy...., I just couldn't put this book down.  This author writes women awesomely. Farrah....you just wanted her win! And Aanon is definitely a man I would mind being on a secluded homestead with. There isn't one thing to not love about this book, strong heroine, sexy man and a great love story!, This is a dark, but powerful story. I love that the author addressed two issues that typical affect women, but had them happen to a man (because they do happen to men as well). It's very emotional and raw. Even when the author is telling a similar story to the first in the series (the save the girl story) she manages to tell it differently, making it new and fresh.  The entire story pulls you in!\\n\\nI think my only issue with the book is that the main female character is so young and the main male character has known her practically all of her life. It just felt like he had a thing for her even when she was really young.  Carrie was a trooper though and stronger than any 20 yr old I know, but Nicole still rocks!, But it's getting weaker as it progresses. So far all the club trouble has been because of these women? Not only that in this book, so much was predictable and so much made me roll my eyes and want to stop reading. All the secrets and who couldn't predict the Dragon situation (don't want to spoil it for those that don't see that coming). I really liked Nicole in part one when she had sense enough to remove the memory card from the phone and when she took the two bullets for Dragon, but in this novel she did just seem dumb, self-centered and just a little annoying.\\n\\nThe bad azz bikers are definitely getting softer but their mouths are still filthy!  Afraid reading this one I would have liked a story about Bull and not Dani and Crusher. It seem they told enough of their story in this book!, Such dirty, filthy talk could be such a turn on?\\n\\nThis book is so steamy and so rough. I couldn't get enough of Roman. If you like alpha males, you'll enjoy this book!\\n\\nAs far as the rest of the storyline, the author created an interesting plot. It's not all sex, there's substance here.\\n\\nGreat, HOT read!, Shifters and MCs....loved the storyline of this book! It's short, sweet and a nice like romance. And I agree, mate is just so much more than a husband or a wife!\\n\\nFlow of this book is great...can't wait to read Ares' story!, I started with Elias and River and that was really like most romantic comedies that I've seen.\\n\\nThen there was Silas and Tempest...not my favorite, but still okay. You may need to read it to understand some parts in Luke's story!\\n\\nLuke, Luke, Luke....what can I say besides I want one! He was awesome, so alpha (oozed sex appeal), funny and mature way beyond 24! Definitely the best read of the three.\\n\\nThe Saint Brothers are definitely worthy of a little praise!, I don't understand how you fall in love with someone who doesn't speak. The heroine of the story does come off as \"dull\". You understand why she's hesitant, but at some point they should have exchanged a meaningful conversation.\\n\\nNot that great....also felt the author could have used a few different descriptive words..., Beaston's story is the best by far in this series. He touches your heart and you're rooting for him! Of course you still have crazy Willa, who makes everyone of these books hilarious, but even without her this story is strong and with the read., Creed was definitely a sexy alpha...but I think what makes this book are the side characters.  The crew is a riot...especially Willa and I love Easton. I can't wait to read his story.\\n\\nWhat you'll get from this story...a true meaning of friendship!, Laugh out loud funny! Willa is a spitfire as some would say. She's intelligent, strong and really draws you in. Matt was awesome and they made a likable pair!, But I do like that there is (spoiler alert) no woman kidnapping and an amazing rescue! I'd give is 3.5 stars.\\n\\nThroughout I think that Charlie's and Eva's navet would have been more believable or less maddening if they came from a small town and not a city. I mean who doesn't know the danger of cartels? Also, I'm always glad when the heroine isn't the maturest 22 or 23 yr old that you'll ever meet but an older woman (in this case Eva was 26), but I was disappointed that she seemed the youngest and most clueless. I was also disappointed when she sprouted off Shakespeare at Will during a fight. That just seemed weird in a MC novel and during a fight against cartel members, well in any fight really!\\n\\nI did like that Will's character challenged the image of the normal biker. Most ppl think people in MCs are uneducated or minimally educated thugs and this gave you a different image. Will's character was struggling and it was good to see him come out okay on the other side even if the storyline was just so-so. I would think that two years is a rather long time for a club to let someone be rogue, but that's just another thing in the storyline I didn't like., I received an advanced review copy in exchange for an honest review...\\n\\nThis is the first MC novel I read where it didn't seem like the club lived the life. Other novels make it seem like the MC lifestyle was grand and legit so I appreciated what in my mind is a truer depiction of what goes on with one percenters. I could even buy into the sex trafficking storyline.\\n\\nAs for Skin and Meg, they were hot. I loved Skin's dirty, filthy mouth. The relationship aspect of the novel falls in line with other MC novels but still worth the read., Some commented that this story was too long and that Luke was a jerk...granted he was an azz but he was struggling and I still lived his character! Harper was a great heroine and you really rooted for her and wanted her to be happy. There were so many stories (lives) wrapped up in this book but they were all perfect together and never too much. You really needed every bit that was in the novel and it made it a great story! Every character was awesome!, That I've read that actually incorporated the true nature of bears. I loved that and the fact that everyone wasn't perfectly beautiful or rich. Really good story, well written and I enjoyed the character of both the hero and heroine., I definitely love that the women in this series aren't fragile, needy or easily manipulated. And I love how the men love them.\\n\\nJenner and Lena had a great story, but I also enjoyed the side characters. Easy read..., Reading MC romances because they started to sound the same with the dirty sex talk and story, but this was a great story to come back to. It managed to be sexy without being dirty (he wasn't calling the girl his good little slut or anything crazy like that) and also the male lead managed to come off as a good guy even though he was a killer.  Also, that cover art was perfect for the man in the book. Sexy mutha! There really wasn't anything I didn't like about the story!, More of an epilogue almost! I'm giving it four stars because even a twenty page book about that sexy rocker Jake Wethers is worth reading....\\n\\nThe end is sad....I almost cried!, Sally? Where does the author get these names? The men have sexy as sin names...given and taken while the women have really unappealing names. Also, how is everyone one of these chicks a virgin? Initially, I almost stopped reading because I was like oh no not another barely legal virgin, but I received an ARC so I gave it a go. The story was ok. I wasn't feeling the arranged marriage thing. It just didn't make since considering the same non-information could have been obtained if the Mother charter would have just embedded one of their own in the club. Also, there were a lot of speeches and kind of repetitive in parts. I kind of found myself wanting it to be over. What did work for me was Asphalt. I love a bad boy. He talked dirty and was all alpha male. Also, the cover art was beautiful. I gave it four stars because I actually really like the bonus book about Blackjack. I thought his story was fairly awesome without being too drawn out or over the top.\\n\\nGood classification as erotica...I guess then the story can just be blah as long as it delivers in other ways.  It's worth the read.\\n\\nI received an ARC in exchange for an honest review!, I thought this was the sweetest, most romantic book! There was no drawn out drama, just a budding relationship. The characters were all developed and there was the perfect amount of back story. Definitely not raunchy but there is some steam!  Really I wanted there to be more to read.\\n\\nExcellent, excellent, excellent!, Cage, a sexy bear shifter, returns home to protect and claim his fated mate, Carrier. There's some obstacles, some drama, some sexy romance and of course the HEA. Worth the read..., I absolutely loved Sam and it was a great story; however, Chloe was annoying. I love a good \"damsel in distress\" story, but the woman can still be strong and sensible. Chloe was just young, dumb and naive....not a good combination and just had me like really every time she did something. Sam and the plot make it worth reading though..., Maybe more aptly titled, but maybe not as sexy. Let's see...the book could use better editing. Throughout the novels the author referred to Cami as Madison and that sometimes breaks up the flow of the reading. Also the transition from book one to book two wasn't fluid. It was almost as if she took a long break I between reading the two and should have gone back for a refresher to get recapped events correct. Again that interrupts the flow of the novel. As for as the context..book gets you interested. Book two keeps you interested in Drew but made me like Cami less. She got a little annoying, but maybe that is because as a reader we knew what Drew was going through and his thoughts than he hadn't shared with her, but BOOK THREE...OMG! I couldn't love Drew anymore! Book three was the perfect romance! The right about of steamy and who doesn't love a sexy many, definitely an alpha, and can cook! I'd definitely recommend this series if only to get to book three alone!, And that's only because I've liked some of Nicole's books in the past but this one just wasn't my cup of tea. It's similarly themed as far as older man falling for younger (22 years old virgin) woman. Firefly was just too crude, like over the top crude and there wasn't anything I liked about Cora.  I also didn't care for the return of Meg and her new role in the club., So I was very surprised to find that this is a series. It took me forever to read and I thought it was rather repetitive. A lot could have been cut out to speed things along. I also wasn't surprised by half of what was revealed until the very last chapter. I will have to continue to read because I need to know how it ends, but I won't be happy about it., Emotional, funny, well written...just great all around. It was the perfect ending to the series! I won't say more because I just want to give all the great parts away...all I can say is READ IT!\\n\\nYOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT;-), I loved everything about Mason...his dominance, loving, caring and acceptance. And he had a fresh story. He was a real beast boar. Beck was actually the first female in the series I didn't particularly care for. She was rather deceitful, which led to her predicament.\\n\\nAs always love that the supporting characters!, I wouldn't mind being loved by mature Silverback Kirk. I loved reading Kirk and Ally love story as well as back stories. They both seem to be broken from their past but find a place, peace and love with each other.\\n\\nI also like how the stories tie together with the Grayback and Firebear series.  Even though these are all standalone stories, you may not understand the return of IESA if you haven't read Firebears. I'm definitely looking forward to Mason's and Clinton's stories and hopefully an end to IESA.\\n\\nAnd for those that want sexy...this is sexy from start to finish. A definite good choice to read..., I'm glad Link got his happy ending and there are lots of happy surprises in this book!\\n\\nVera and the Dawson's provide some comic relief, but really it's Link's strength and alpha maleness that made me love this book. From the beginning he was just all man and straightforward!\\n\\nGreat read!, Some reviews don't like the hibernation angle but with so many shifter romances out there, that's what makes this one stand out.\\n\\nAs for Tobias...I loved him and how he was transformed by love...well at least less growly. Vera was another heroine I could get behind. She was super funny and kept the book interesting (she kind of reminded me of Willa from the Grayback series...if you haven't read, I definitely recommend).\\n\\nI guess I would say the only baby thing about this book was I vaguely remember a baby being mentioned in Jenner's book but there was no mention of one in this book and also the living seems a little rustic to be 2015, but if you imagine the story set in a different era you'll love everything.\\n\\nI'm ecstatic to read Link's story and I am sure based on the three released to date that I won't be disappointed!, But I couldn't finish it. I did at least get a little beyond 50%, but that took weeks so I gave up. I'm fairly sure I'm done with the series. I don't understand the appeal of the foul-mouth, treat me like shyt, but you're it for me storyline. I also don't care for the virgin, young girl with the older badass biker guy. I don't know, I just didn't find anything redeeming about this book...and the editing was terrible.\\n\\nI received an ARC in exchange for an honest review., Dalton was a sexy beast and Kate was the perfect mate. I loved the banter and this plot twist, or \"the drama\", was really intriguing and fresh. I was kind of disappointed that Clayton turned out to still be a jerk...I guess that means no sweet novella for him. Can't wait to read Chance!!!!, And I thought this was a great way to close it out. Chance was definitely a sexy wolf and the heroine was pretty awesome even though she was an assassin so to speak.\\n\\nVery funny and a nice little romance!, And different from other paranormal romances. I liked that it wasn't too drama filled. It was the right amount of back story, suspense and the perfect ending.  Also, who wouldn't fall for a man that can cook!, But I didn't like this one as much as the first. I guess (spoiler alert) there is something more appealing about the shifter-human relationship than the shifter-shifter relationship, so I don't like the idea that they can \"change\" humans. Also, I'm not sure how I feel about them IEAS and going public storyline, but I guess you need some adversity.\\n\\nAs for the characters, it was the opposites attract kind of attraction. They were written well but I don't know that I actually felt it., This was definitely the steamiest out of the Fire Bears Series...I also laughed out loud for parts of the story. It was emotional and I think a little more than just a shifter romance novel...hopeful maybe (in a metaphoric way).\\n\\nThe only thing that I don't like about this series if that the humans don't stay human...but the love and the bond is awesome!, Couldn't put it down. I like that it was short and not dragged out.\\n\\nThe Breck Crew were honorable. I liked that aspect of the novel. I also loved Cody, his strength and not letting past hurts prevent him from loving Rory. I also loved that Rory was strong and didn't cower when things got tough.\\n\\nGood read!, But fast-paced. I think the entire book took place within three weeks.\\n\\nI liked the finding love again angle and the idea of when you know just knowing and going with it, but I still thought it could be a little more building of the relationships.\\n\\nI also would have liked an epilogue., Sexier than they read...lol! The dialogue was a slight turn off, because I couldn't imagine the words\"ye\" or \"yer\" coming across as sexy. Outside of that it was an okay read. I liked the bucket list angle, but there was a little too much drama with all the jumping to conclusions and no one just having an adult conversation. I'm guessing characters were you adults...be advised if you like maturer characters, dialogue and situations.\\n\\n3 and 1/2 stars!!!, A long read. I didn't feel the chemistry and the back and forth bickering was more annoying that endearing. Maybe there could have been a couple more chapters where an actual relationship or feelings developed. But it's a sweet, western romance and I love those...so I'd recommend!, I don't think I realized what a new adult romance was until I read this.  Rather young, would not recommend for adult readers looking for a good romance novel.  It really is written for young adults...anywhere from ages 18-22.  Immature a bit., It's actually the same story line as the first six books.  I don't know why I keep buying them....mostly because I started the series so I have to finish it, but I'm also hoping one will become it's own book.  You have the same group embrace, engagement, someone gets married, someone else gets married, and a pregnancy is announced.  The only new twist to this book was they threw in a gay couple to try and shake things up.  I will say it's not awful, but it's a long read because you feel like you've read it before.  Very predictable!, Good story line and flow. The drama was real and not overly dramatic. Of course, Zach was amazing from start to finish, Presley not so much.\\n\\nGood read if you like second chance romances., I liked this second addition to the Gamble Brother series a little better than the first because it was a love story developing and I enjoyed their journey. I also could appreciate that the lead female was not depicted as the norm, but rather eclectic and her own person., I'd give it 3.5 stars! It's steamy and hot and a fairly decent romance. I loved BJ and how he loved Layla, but I guess I would have liked a more dramatic ending.\\n\\nI can't say mush more without giving it away, but I'd say if you like filthy language and reformed bad boys give it a read., Good book! Fast read! I don't think I read in the description that it was also a suspense so that was a nice surprise....as well as whodunit;-), Who wouldn't love a good looking doctor? I liked the old time feel of the book and values even though it was set in modern times. I liked that it made me laugh out loud as well as make me dreamy. The only thing I didn't like was the strong friendship angle and the lack of honest communication, seemed conflicting., So much so I read it in one day! Let me get the dislikes out of the way really quickly...Stevie gave her son too much power over her decisions and thats about it! I loved everything else about this book. I loved that Stevie was the usual long haired (blonde or red headed), blue or green eyed dream...I loved that Ethan struggled with a real issue...all the supporting characters were relevant. Just a great book all around, so good!, I really didn't want to put this book down and it's perfect to read heading into the holiday season. If you're a Hallmark movie kind of person, this book is definitely for you!, And as they go this was a fairly decent one, I just wish it was more about the main characters. I am guessing because this is the first in a series, the supporting cast had to be strong and interesting, but I don't think anything significant happened between Zoe and Roland until I was 50% into the book. But the supporting characters really kept me going and I am most looking forward to Leos story., It may be unfair to write a review when I didn't finish the book, but I couldn't. From the beginning, I had reservations. The first was came when Rex man-handled and acted like a jerk toward Tabby and he response was to be turned on. That's a no for me. I don't get the books where there is this antagonistic relationship or rudeness on the part of the male and the female just has no control over herself and is attracted to a jerk essential. I've never experienced it and so it always makes me roll my eyes. Second, Tabby from the beginning seemed to over familiarize herself with Rex and his kids. Have you ever been to a hotel or lodge where food gets delivered and the person starts to ask personal questions or had a hotel employee let themselves into your room and sit on your bed and start a conversation with your children? Yeah me either so another eye roll. Also, when reading this book and discovering Rex has a secret you wouldn't believe that he went into the shower and left his room door opened for someone to enter anyway, but that's whatever. Lastly, when Rex refers to another of the hotel employees as \"the fat old woman\", I was done. Tabby is only attracted to him for superficial reasons, which didn't keep me interested in the book. Had he had one good quality or a better attitude, maybe I would have gotten further, but I couldn't. Sorry Nicole!, If I didn't have to read Jamie and Chase's story.  I liked how the author addressed some of the issues that pregnant women face, but mostly I just liked reading about a loving couple.  Throughout the series I didn't see the relevance of Anna being a \"big girl\", but over all the series was smart, funny, even if poorly edited.\\n\\nOverall series gets a four and a half from me...only rated this last book so low because of the inclusion of Chase and Jamie's story.  Worth a read and books 1-4 were free!, Some complained about how easily Nina submitted to the love triangle, but she's a woman with needs and desires and though she didn't intend to \"put out on the first date\" things happen and to me it didn't make her seem weaker than she asserted, just more in tuned to her body and going after what she wanted!\\n\\nIf I had to be a part of a mnage I'd definitely want Aeden and Soren in the mix with me. So willing to please and both alphas to boot! Sexy all around...\\n\\nWriting is appropriate to the storyline, but maybe I would have liked an epilogue to see that they stayed happy and that she made got preggers or had some cubs!, Axel was sexy...and who doesn't love authoritative and dominant men. Emma was a pretty smart heroine. I thought that maybe she was a little quick to forgive Axel and at times a little needy, but otherwise she made smart moves. The storyline was solid. I was glad to see the Tsepov drama come to a head and the author introduced a ton of sexy, alpha men who's book I'm looking forward to, but enjoyed coming across in The Temptation Trap. I will say it was a little long and in some parts repetitive, but still a good story over all. I don't know that I trust the author's BBW classification, but otherwise a definite recommend.\\n\\nI received an ARC in exchange for an honest review., I never understand why the women in bodies have to be such headaches, but its probably because were emotional and unstable creatures. That aside Shannons behavior was understandable even if it made me want to just punch her at times. She really redeemed herself in the end. Greg, like every hero, was swoon worthy. I loved him from beginning to end.\\n\\nI would have liked something added at the end about Gregs foundation even though you can figure out what happened with it.\\n\\nDefinitely recommend!, Keisha was likable and Conner seemed lickable;) This book has a little bit of drama, romance and even touches on domestic violence a little (message: its not always physical...if its toxic, get out). Anyway, enjoyed!, Great plot and execution by the author. There wasn't a bunch of unnecessary storyline. This was a little different from other shifter stories in that they weren't a secret species which I liked. Connor seemed sexy as all get out...and Cassie was a heroine you could get behind!, Because Dutch is a sexy beast!\\n\\nWhat I didn't like was the woman was also a shifter. I kind of like the shifter-human mate dynamic. Plus she was almost as bad azz as the guys in the book. I also didn't like it was yet another woman in hiding and trying to hide a child.\\n\\nOther than those few things the book was a good read. There is a continuous theme in all the books so I  am guessing in the last book is where it all comes to a head. Looking forward to it.\\n\\nStrong heroine...conflict different from the first two in series but it all still makes sense and is relevant., Even though it was similar to the others with the hidden pregnancy. You would actually think that these guys can sense they knocked up the girl or at least had an inkling considered it happened to everyone other squad person but ok! The Arctics storyline continued but was different and really interesting. You can tell it's not done but we'll see which characters the author comes up with to finish that aspect.\\n\\nKelis was bad azz without being so dominant that I didn't like her character. And who wouldn't want to have two sexy men after them.\\n\\nDefinitely worth the read but bare with the errors!, Because I didn't like someone getting hurt for this story to work, but it worked some beautifully. I like that even though theres drama its not over the top, but still impactful. I even almost cried at one part of the story.\\n\\nReally good read..., And because Kayson was so fantastically written Im giving this book four stars. I didn't care for Ariel at all. Ive never been a girl who gets making the next man pay for the sins of the last so that storyline always makes me roll my eyes. She was just too insecure and all over the place. The danger storyline was predictable and a little weirdly executed, but the Iron Orchids shenanigans make it bearable., But a good read. A little erotic, but the story has merit. Rose is a little annoying, but she's also young and finds clarity. There was a perfect amount of drama and suspenses...nothing's drawn out.\\n\\nNice little blend of western romance and a little kink..., I definitely love Gabe and Elle is ok. I cant really tell how old she is or in what era this book is supposed to be set in. Elle seems very sheltered and to not have very much life experience. She does come across as kind of high maintenance and judgmental, but thats where the opposites attract thing comes into play, because Gabe is the complete opposite...down-to-earth and a real, relatable character.\\n\\nIts kind of a quick fall, so I recommend this book for ppl who like the world-wind kind of romance., I was really excited about the description and for the most part it was ok, but I'm not sure I like how this author writes black women. I also thought some of the \"dramatic\" events were too rushed...it was like they were added for effect or impact, but they were also resolved so quickly that I was like did something just happened. She could have actually left it out considering how little it impacted the story.\\n\\nAnyway, like I said it was ok...predictable of course...some spelling errors and missing words, but it doesn't mess with the flow too terribly., I usually don't read books with characters that are so young, but I was glad the author kept the story age appropriate. I loved all of the characters especially Liam, Sebastian and Charlie.\\n\\nStory is pretty predictable, but still a good read. If youve every watched the movie Return to Me, youll love this book., I loved Lincoln throughout all three books. Kali was a little annoying at times with her attitude, but still loved her as well. All of the characters and storylines were well developed and delivered. I experienced a range of emotions which is a good thing, a great thing! I wouldnt mind a surprise fourth book...PLEASE!, I didn't want to put it down. I actually didn't realize it was a trilogy and before I even finished the first one I was looking for the second and third.\\n\\nThe storyline is real, the character are real, the emotion is real...I almost cried a couple of times. Absolutely can't wait to read what's next for Lincoln and Kali., So I decided to read this book because of the one and two star ratings. I thought they were funny and had my interest piqued. I didn't like Eadyth. I did think she was smart and strong, but she didn't come across as torn between two loves, but more just kind of skanky (did they use the term wanton back then)\\nand wanting to have several lovers. I actually thought the brothers deserved better, especially Hjalmar. It seemed to me that he only settled for the sharing idea because he really wanted her. I would have to do like period research to see if that kind of thing was even a thing (lol)her keeping both of them as lovers and having both of their children. I was like huh. Its one thing to get your threesome on, but that was going a tad bit over-the-top. But its a somewhat steamy read and the story itself isn't bad, but the relationship between the three was just weird.]   \n",

       "      <td>The Killer\\n\\nFun and stylish, mostly. The voiceover, particularly in the first act, reeked of simply not trusting the audience; A version of this opening playing with no dialogue would have been a stone-cold classic. &lt;PERSON&gt; is pretty good here, and when she shows up, the scene with &lt;PERSON&gt; is fantastic.\\n\\nI think people are overstating the politics a bit, or, rather, the politics are definitely there, but it is also basically just a rehashing of the politics of the &lt;PERSON&gt; franchise. It uses the killer-for-hire setting to comment on how an elite have increasingly insulated themselves from average citizens, and how they expect to play by different rules than those beneath them, freely changing the rules and agreements to suit their own agendas.\\n\\nStill, it is enough fun (and funny; the killer is pretty bad at his job sometimes!) that I think this would have been a four for me until the ending. But why he let the billionaire live after killing people much, much less culpable was frankly baffling to me. Thematically, I guess you could say that is a comment on who is above consequences too, but again &lt;PERSON&gt; is better at this. Here there's no real reason why he can't just kill the client, so for me it breaks the plot. Some lipservice is paid that the cops would investigate it more seriously since he was rich, but honestly the target at the beginning seemed pretty well off too; and are we to believe he never killed any wealthy or high-profile people? Why wasn't it a concern previously?\\n\\nIt left me with a bad taste in my mouth, which is probably the point, but I think &lt;PERSON&gt; got lazy in doing the heavy lifting that would have made the thematic point he wanted to make make narrative sense.</td>\n",

You're hired in, pay is decent, working remote - in my case, \"you'll be taking about 14-20ish calls a day, waiting around watching Netflix\" this is the life of a claims adjuster.\\n\\nWell, needless to say : Not the case.\\n\\nFast forward two years.\\n\\nI'm now a team lead for customer service, with the ability to jump in and handle claims. If it's not one thing it's another, but I do enjoy my job. I get to fix people's screw ups and help assist contract holders, and answer questions and whatnot. Aside for the job having it's pros and cons, it appears the \"higher ups\" always have their priorities in line.\\n\\nAvailability time.\\n\\nMy job requires me to remain available to perform it, and unfortunately..if I were to remain available, I'd be non-stop taking claims calls, then being asked questions between calls from customer service..taking \"supervisor\" calls (don't even get me started), all at once. Overall, too much.\\n\\nOne of my coworkers was on the chopping block because of high \"unavailable\" times, and it was made known he needed to fix it. Unfortunately he decided to leave because he felt like he couldn't do his job and got sick of the email threats from our manager.\\n\\nWell, less than a week later: I got that email. 80% unavailable time. Keep in mind, I am working. Fixing other people's claims and getting them authorized, addressing dissatisfied customers concerns and either putting a stop to them or assisting as much as possible. I am, in theory..a supervisor, but paid significantly less, as my title is a \"hybrid\" - team lead for customer service and a claims adjuster.\\n\\nAppears to me that all companies that follow metrics almost militantly, are either upset you're too available, too unavailable, etc.\\n\\nI'll be honest, I'm a foot out the door. I already know what's coming and I made it apparent to my manager that this whole issue goes against me taking the team lead position.\\n\\nI basically was met with \"my hands are tied, not my problem, adhere to it or you'll get warnings\" etc.\\n\\nAnyone else experiencing this?</td>\n",

       "      <td>Dogs have feelings too.\\n\\nWhat I learned from thinking about my dog's feelings, and my advice to you\\n\\nContext: My dog &lt;PERSON&gt; is a sweetheart, but he has extreme separation anxiety. He was also adopted from my mother-in-law, whose ex-fiancee fed him whatever human food he was eating himself at the moment. Because of these two things, &lt;PERSON&gt; is a very needy and vocal dog, and it can be frustrating to navigate his wants and desires as they often feel like an inconvenience.\\n\\nI felt this way about &lt;PERSON&gt; for our first two years together; however, I had a huge epiphany when I came across animals who use assistive communication devices such as Ellie the Cockatoo and &lt;PERSON&gt;.\\n\\nThe Revelation: The animals who are trained to communicate using iPads and buttons with speakers have fundamentally changed the way I understand animals' consciousness. They are able to express when they are sad, mad, afraid, lonely, bored, and even tell jokes.\\n\\nAfter watching hours and hours of this talking animal content, it suddenly felt extremely inhumane to deny &lt;PERSON&gt; of the things I knew he was asking for, just on his body language alone. It also made me wonder about all the things he wants but isn't getting because I don't understand what he is trying to say.\\n\\nBased on this new knowledge, I decided to think of his wants and needs just as if he were a person, and it would be wrong of me to deny him of things because 1) I am kind of his parent and 2) it is very anthropocentric or \"people-centered\" to think that my needs and wants are more important than his.\\n\\nThe biggest and most immediate change between us was allowing him in the bed. He became so much more comfortable with me and my wife being gone during the day because he apparently just wanted to snuggle with us all night and recharge his cuddle battery. He quickly stopped doing naughty things like going through the trash and tearing up paper, things I now know he did to express that he was upset.\\n\\nSo if you have a pet who gets into mischievious things or has some other behavioral problem that you just can't seem to solve, try thinking about their feelings as just another being with feelings as opposed to as their pet parent. You will be surprised at how simple some of these issues are to solve by just giving them your undivided attention for 10 minutes a day, for example.</td>\n",

I haven't read &lt;PERSON&gt;'s novel so I could be off-base with this, but I have a hard time believing that this is all that watered-down in the sheer intricate structuring of the world when compared to the novel. It works best when following the story of a kid putting on a brave face while reckoning with the fact that he may just be the messiah (which is interesting since BLADE RUNNER 2049 did the opposite, following someone coming to grips with the fact that they're not the chosen one after all), but a good few stretches of this wind up feeling like someone reading you the LOTR Appendices instead of the actual story itself -- mythology for the sake of mythology. Still, you have to give the suits at WB credit for not getting weak at the knees over all the gobbledygook crammed into these 2+ hours. For as vocal as &lt;PERSON&gt; was this time last year about their sudden theatrical/streaming hybrid release announcement (which he was totally justified in complaining about), at least they didn't pull the same kind of crap that &lt;PERSON&gt; did with &lt;PERSON&gt; and just slice his movie to incomprehensible bits - so, credit where credit is due, I guess.\\n\\nStill, it's hard to fully get a feeling for this Part One alone without the context of where things will go in the second film. By itself, this one feels mostly like a giant prologue, setting up a long string of plot devices that'll get paid off later on down the road which, I dunno, I guess is fine considering that that's the direction a lot of big genre content is going in these days - preferring serialized films that are so tightly connected to their follow-ups that they hardly have a leg of their own to really stand on, as opposed to something like, say FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING which managed to lay huge groundwork, establish its relationships, move its chess pieces, and raise the stakes all with its own individual emotional payoff and a sense of roundedness, i.e. it worked as both a standalone film and as a part of a trilogy. My feeling could change but right now DUNE - PART ONE feels exactly like its final line of dialogue -- \"This is just the beginning...\"\\n\\nThose sandworms though. &lt;PERSON&gt; kills at doing massive scale.</td>\n",

The drugs, the gambling, the scum, the darkness, the violence, all just naturally exists around him and he is just a part of the city’s routine. He cannot break free of its immoral, corruptive nature. He is bound to it.\\n—\\n&lt;PERSON&gt; contrasts innocence with depravity. The lieutenant drops his kids to school and takes a hit straight after. He wakes up the next day next to a toddler, still wasted from the night before, the drug dealer shown trying to make ends meet for his family and the nun is corrupted. Despite being such a cynical film, I believe &lt;PERSON&gt; tries to shine glimpses of hope on his city.\\n—\\nThe film doesn’t really stop. It’s scene after scene of some misdeed, mistake or wrongdoing. It literally doesn’t stop gambling, drinking, destroying, or drugging. Neither does the lieutenant. Neither does New York. It’s a fast track to destruction in one way or another. There’s no escape. It never seems like his redemption is possible until the very end but by then it’s too late. The nightclubs, shootings, drugs, stack on top of one another, an evil momentum constantly building, and &lt;PERSON&gt;’s soaring use of music enhances this build up all the more. You feel doomed from the very start.\\n—\\nFerrara is fascinating in so many ways. This is his peak shit, and one of my all time favourite movies. It genuinely blows me away every time I see it. Underrated.</td>\n",

It went undetected by many (including me) and suddenly appeared as a Best Picture nomination. I decided to watch it and am quite glad that I did so.\\n\\nFirst of all, the two leads absolutely carry this film. They delivered stellar performances and easily elevated the effectiveness of this film. They had so much chemistry as mother and son. As another note, that scene with &lt;PERSON&gt; rolling out of the truck almost made me pass out. It was mostly due to the fact that I honestly cared about the fate of the main characters, and that was easily the most suspenseful scene of the film (was so well done too).\\n\\nThe one thing I think I can judge this film on plot wise is that I would've liked to have seen more content from the real world, as well as more on how &lt;PERSON&gt; got into 'Room'.\\n\\nIs Room going to win Best Picture?

Recursive nightmare logic and paranoiac fugue states. Politically inscrutable ninja cabals carrying out clandestine assassinations. Deep state double agents getting a handle on &lt;PERSON&gt;. &lt;PERSON&gt; letting slide a late career &lt;PERSON&gt;. A paycheck is a paycheck to this none-too-picky Master Ninja. I might have been hallucinating, but I’m pretty sure his earring got slightly bigger in each scene.\\n\\nThis is awful and I loved every minute of it. The middle hour is just people saying the names &lt;PERSON&gt;, &lt;PERSON&gt;, &lt;PERSON&gt; and &lt;PERSON&gt; over and over again, and never once was I able to glean the meaning of any of it. I don’t think I could explain the plot of this to you if my life depended on it. Something about terrorism and honor and ninjas and dick measuring. And there’s a ton of weird echoey &lt;PERSON&gt; Voiceover, which I can only intuit is meant to represent his character’s dim-witted inner monologue. He’s like if &lt;PERSON&gt; in &lt;PERSON&gt;’s Dune had a 78 IQ.\\n\\nThere’s actually some decent action in this, with the highlight being the big showdown between &lt;PERSON&gt; and the red-hooded henchman from the killer poster art. I mean, they’re not doing any super impressive choreography or anything, but the fight feels raw and intense and the camera never cuts or shakes around. Sure, it ain’t &lt;PERSON&gt;, but at least it seems like an altercation transpiring between flesh-and-blood human beings on planet earth. Sometimes we forget what that looks and feels like.\\n\\nI caught bits and pieces of this on UHF television when I was maybe 8 or 9 years old in ‘85 or ‘86. It’s fucking hilarious to think of my youngest kids watching The Octagon. Their pop culture upbringing now is as vastly different to what I experienced growing up in the 80’s as mine was to that of the fucking pilgrims. Trying to imagine my angelic daughter sitting through Dirty Harry with commercial breaks on network television at 1PM on a Sunday like I did countless times when I was her age.

We meet a troubled security guard named &lt;PERSON&gt; (&lt;PERSON&gt;), who begins working at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. &lt;PERSON&gt; is the sole guardian of his little sister &lt;PERSON&gt; (&lt;PERSON&gt;) after the loss of their mother.

It’s pretty straightforward at the beginning until the dream sequences with &lt;PERSON&gt;. His dreams are meant to tell him about the man who had kidnapped his younger brother all those years ago, but all it does is connect him to other children, the ghost children in the animatronic puppets at &lt;PERSON&gt; Pizzeria.\\n\\nOn paper, this sounds interesting, and it had the potential to be a wicked supernatural horror film, but it falls short. The focus on &lt;PERSON&gt; and the actual children took away from the menacing animatronic puppets that do all the killing. Instead of working in the lore from the games, the actual gameplay should have been integrated. It became dream sequences upon dream sequences and only one sequence of the animatronic puppets coming out for the scares. The editing also ruined the tension because once the animatronic puppets were out of the frame and walking through the halls, it would cut to the recurring dream. Understandably, they wanted to make this family-friendly, but the 14A rating did not allow these filmmakers the creative freedom to integrate more kills.\\n\\nclick here for my full review</td>\n",

I'm friendly for the most part but I don't want you being inappropriate with me. He started one conversation with, \"You get really good discounts, maybe we could share a hotel room.\" Right there I started feeling uncomfortable so I responded with, \"That's not appropriate to ask me in my place of work.\" He apologized and left. He had a couple more run in's with me like that until he invited me to his place. I reported him to the directors of the fitness side because that's a whole different department.\\n\\nOnce I reported him to the directors, he didn't even look at me while passing by! That stopped for a few weeks and then it started up again a few weeks ago. The first thing he did was come up to my desk and tell me how lonely he is. I told him to come to the club and relax with the other club members. He wanted to be my friend and get my number. That too was very inappropriate but I declined. I recently started seeing someone so that would help me. Our old man asked if I was seeing anyone and I said yes! Mr. thinks he's smooth said, \"Oh he's far too old for you, you should give me a chance!\" I looked at him because the guy I'm currently seeing is only three years older than me, not 62 years older than me. I shook my head no and told him that I was happy.\\n\\nThe last time he came in was Friday night. He asked how my little affair was going and I told him it was more than a little affair and I was happy. He then asked more personal questions about the things I do with my new boyfriend. That not right and thankfully one of the club side managers overheard him and told him he is going to report him for sexual harassment. I thanked him but this has been an ongoing problem.

I work at a bank: 1. I have asthma and one day I knew an attack was coming on, so I needed to leave. It was 5:27pm and I was scheduled until 5:30PM. I asked to leave she said “You’re making a habit of this”. Mind you I have only missed work once, because I fainted doing hot yoga. I made it known I had asthma from the beginning. Now even when I am having asthma I don’t mention it to anyone.\\n\\n1. All of my coworkers were going out to lunch with for her and another coworkers birthday. She was asking what the best day for everyone (context: I have no family here, and I’m basically alone) Everyone else has families or are married. I was excited and told her I wouldn’t be busy at all so whatever day was decided was good for me, she responded “We weren’t asking you, I didn’t think you would be busy” and laughed.\\n\\n2. Yesterday, we were preparing for for our district manager to visit and I happen to be off the day of. While everyone was debating calling out and nervous, I said “Well, I’m glad to be off” and she said “I’m glad you are too, cause we need our strongest tellers only” I absolutely resented this cause I am in fact the strongest teller. I’m leading in NBS… I also have 100 percent for surveys and customers are constantly raving about my service. One time her own boss told her that if she wanted to suggest me for another position, he would co-sign.\\n\\nI don’t know if because I am a jokester, maybe she thinks these comments are also jokes. I am very respectful of her and honestly all my coworkers joke with each other but not like this at all. We are all passed “professional” jokes as coworkers. We can kind of get away with some off-color jokes like for example our service manager got a BBL so one of my coworkers joked that when we get coins from the vault we can just stack them on her ass.\\n\\nI am a lesbian and we were having an outing, someone suggested we all bring our partners and one of my coworkers said that he wasn’t bringing his wife because I might steal here, I said no we can share and since then he’s been my sister husband.\\n\\nAnyways nothing really malicious, maybe I am being too sensitive? Do you think I should discuss this with her? I don’t want her to feel uncomfortable to joke with me after this. I just don’t want her to be cruel.</td>\n",

I believe &lt;PERSON&gt; performance is the greatest ever put to film.\\n—\\nTogether, they embody a character that is just fascinating to watch. You never empathise with him, but you do not hate him. It always has stricken me that the &lt;PERSON&gt; is a product of his own environment. NYC is the villain, the enabler. The drugs, the gambling, the scum, the darkness, the violence, all just naturally exists around him and he is just a part of the city’s routine. He cannot break free of its immoral, corruptive nature. He is bound to it.\\n—\\n&lt;PERSON&gt; contrasts innocence with depravity. The lieutenant drops his kids to school and takes a hit straight after. He wakes up the next day next to a toddler, still wasted from the night before, the drug dealer shown trying to make ends meet for his family and the nun is corrupted. Despite being such a cynical film, I believe &lt;PERSON&gt; tries to shine glimpses of hope on his city.\\n—\\nThe film doesn’t really stop. It’s scene after scene of some misdeed, mistake or wrongdoing. It literally doesn’t stop gambling, drinking, destroying, or drugging. Neither does the lieutenant. Neither does New York. It’s a fast track to destruction in one way or another. There’s no escape. It never seems like his redemption is possible until the very end but by then it’s too late. The nightclubs, shootings, drugs, stack on top of one another, an evil momentum constantly building, and &lt;PERSON&gt;’s soaring use of music enhances this build up all the more. You feel doomed from the very start.\\n—\\nFerrara is fascinating in so many ways. This is his peak shit, and one of my all time favourite movies. It genuinely blows me away every time I see it. Underrated.</td>\n",

       "      <td>&lt;PERSON&gt; of Inisherin\\n\\nI was really ready to flip for this and kind of didn’t, I think in part because I spent almost all of the movie wondering why I was supposed to feel any empathy for &lt;PERSON&gt; character and his insanely callous behavior, and then in part because man, it just went all the way to the dark side by the end and I guess I wasn’t completely ready for it.\\n\\nBut…\\n\\nI’m getting that feeling that I sometimes get when a movie gets under my skin and I haven’t realized it yet. Gonna give it a week or two and maybe another viewing. It’s beautifully made and it really commits, as does everyone who appears in it. A lot less funny than In Bruges but a lot less clunky as a drama than Three Billboards, he did find a good balance this time.</td>\n",

She gives one of my favorite performances of 2022 and I really do hope she gets more roles that show off her acting abilities like this one! The cinematography gives off old movie vibes and I could not get enough of it! The huge ass monologue near the end of the movie blew me away because honestly I wasn’t expecting it to be in the movie! The movie genuinely scared me and made me uncomfortable on multiple occasions (mainly that scarecrow scene the less said the better) &lt;PERSON&gt; and &lt;PERSON&gt; did a amazing job of making us feel as isolated from the world as &lt;PERSON&gt;!

The voiceover, particularly in the first act, reeked of simply not trusting the audience; A version of this opening playing with no dialogue would have been a stone-cold classic. <PERSON> is pretty good here, and when she shows up, the scene with <PERSON> is fantastic.\\n\\nI think people are overstating the politics a bit, or, rather, the politics are definitely there, but it is also basically just a rehashing of the politics of the <PERSON> franchise. It uses the killer-for-hire setting to comment on how an elite have increasingly insulated themselves from average citizens, and how they expect to play by different rules than those beneath them, freely changing the rules and agreements to suit their own agendas.\\n\\nStill, it is enough fun (and funny; the killer is pretty bad at his job sometimes!) that I think this would have been a four for me until the ending. But why he let the billionaire live after killing people much, much less culpable was frankly baffling to me. Thematically, I guess you could say that is a comment on who is above consequences too, but again <PERSON> is better at this. Here there's no real reason why he can't just kill the client, so for me it breaks the plot. Some lipservice is paid that the cops would investigate it more seriously since he was rich, but honestly the target at the beginning seemed pretty well off too; and are we to believe he never killed any wealthy or high-profile people? Why wasn't it a concern previously?\\n\\nIt left me with a bad taste in my mouth, which is probably the point, but I think <PERSON> got lazy in doing the heavy lifting that would have made the thematic point he wanted to make make narrative sense.   \n",

You're hired in, pay is decent, working remote - in my case, \"you'll be taking about 14-20ish calls a day, waiting around watching Netflix\" this is the life of a claims adjuster.\\n\\nWell, needless to say : Not the case.\\n\\nFast forward two years.\\n\\nI'm now a team lead for customer service, with the ability to jump in and handle claims. If it's not one thing it's another, but I do enjoy my job. I get to fix people's screw ups and help assist contract holders, and answer questions and whatnot. Aside for the job having it's pros and cons, it appears the \"higher ups\" always have their priorities in line.\\n\\nAvailability time.\\n\\nMy job requires me to remain available to perform it, and unfortunately..if I were to remain available, I'd be non-stop taking claims calls, then being asked questions between calls from customer service..taking \"supervisor\" calls (don't even get me started), all at once. Overall, too much.\\n\\nOne of my coworkers was on the chopping block because of high \"unavailable\" times, and it was made known he needed to fix it. Unfortunately he decided to leave because he felt like he couldn't do his job and got sick of the email threats from our manager.\\n\\nWell, less than a week later: I got that email. 80% unavailable time. Keep in mind, I am working. Fixing other people's claims and getting them authorized, addressing dissatisfied customers concerns and either putting a stop to them or assisting as much as possible. I am, in theory..a supervisor, but paid significantly less, as my title is a \"hybrid\" - team lead for customer service and a claims adjuster.\\n\\nAppears to me that all companies that follow metrics almost militantly, are either upset you're too available, too unavailable, etc.\\n\\nI'll be honest, I'm a foot out the door. I already know what's coming and I made it apparent to my manager that this whole issue goes against me taking the team lead position.\\n\\nI basically was met with \"my hands are tied, not my problem, adhere to it or you'll get warnings\" etc.\\n\\nAnyone else experiencing this?   \n",

There's a moment in the opening, with <PERSON> as a POW in Vietnam, where he is trying to avoid a guy trying to stab him, and so help me he does a little soft shoe shuffle out of the way.

He was also adopted from my mother-in-law, whose ex-fiancee fed him whatever human food he was eating himself at the moment. Because of these two things, <PERSON> is a very needy and vocal dog, and it can be frustrating to navigate his wants and desires as they often feel like an inconvenience.\\n\\nI felt this way about <PERSON> for our first two years together; however, I had a huge epiphany when I came across animals who use assistive communication devices such as Ellie the Cockatoo and <PERSON>.\\n\\nThe Revelation: The animals who are trained to communicate using iPads and buttons with speakers have fundamentally changed the way I understand animals' consciousness. They are able to express when they are sad, mad, afraid, lonely, bored, and even tell jokes.\\n\\nAfter watching hours and hours of this talking animal content, it suddenly felt extremely inhumane to deny <PERSON> of the things I knew he was asking for, just on his body language alone. It also made me wonder about all the things he wants but isn't getting because I don't understand what he is trying to say.\\n\\nBased on this new knowledge, I decided to think of his wants and needs just as if he were a person, and it would be wrong of me to deny him of things because 1) I am kind of his parent and 2) it is very anthropocentric or \"people-centered\" to think that my needs and wants are more important than his.\\n\\nThe biggest and most immediate change between us was allowing him in the bed. He became so much more comfortable with me and my wife being gone during the day because he apparently just wanted to snuggle with us all night and recharge his cuddle battery. He quickly stopped doing naughty things like going through the trash and tearing up paper, things I now know he did to express that he was upset.\\n\\nSo if you have a pet who gets into mischievious things or has some other behavioral problem that you just can't seem to solve, try thinking about their feelings as just another being with feelings as opposed to as their pet parent. You will be surprised at how simple some of these issues are to solve by just giving them your undivided attention for 10 minutes a day, for example.   \n",

And I gotta say, a lot of the jokes landed.\\n\\nBest for me was the utter lack of an attempt at a \"swing to the serious in the final act\" blunder made by something like 90% of comedies. Nope! If anything, they it just got funnier and more irreverent. It just kept going after the genre--and, perhaps, the subject matter--with its eyes always on the laughs.\\n\\nHulu informed me that this was from the makers of The Naked Gun, and I was a little doubtful. By the end, the fingerprints were unmistakable, especially when it descends into utter mayhem in the final act. This doesn't have the tears of mirth and guffaws I got from those classics, but the laughter was there, and consistently.\\n\\nIf you LOVE those classics... you'll probably like this.   \n",
       "7   <PERSON>\\n\\nVisually speaking, this is as gargantuan as anything that <PERSON> made in his late career, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA and RYAN'S DAUGHTER in particular, and it's as beautifully realized and rendered as you could ask for, combining <PERSON>'s grandeur with the lived-in grit and grim <PERSON> brought to STAR WARS and <PERSON> to SOLARIS.\\n\\nIt's as portentous and weighty as you could imagine (and then some), and so utterly steeped in mythology in a way that's simultaneously riveting and frustrating. I haven't read <PERSON>'s novel so I could be off-base with this, but I have a hard time believing that this is all that watered-down in the sheer intricate structuring of the world when compared to the novel. It works best when following the story of a kid putting on a brave face while reckoning with the fact that he may just be the messiah (which is interesting since BLADE RUNNER 2049 did the opposite, following someone coming to grips with the fact that they're not the chosen one after all), but a good few stretches of this wind up feeling like someone reading you the LOTR Appendices instead of the actual story itself -- mythology for the sake of mythology. Still, you have to give the suits at WB credit for not getting weak at the knees over all the gobbledygook crammed into these 2+ hours. For as vocal as <PERSON> was this time last year about their sudden theatrical/streaming hybrid release announcement (which he was totally justified in complaining about), at least they didn't pull the same kind of crap that <PERSON> did with <PERSON> and just slice his movie to incomprehensible bits - so, credit where credit is due, I guess.\\n\\nStill, it's hard to fully get a feeling for this Part One alone without the context of where things will go in the second film. By itself, this one feels mostly like a giant prologue, setting up a long string of plot devices that'll get paid off later on down the road which, I dunno, I guess is fine considering that that's the direction a lot of big genre content is going in these days - preferring serialized films that are so tightly connected to their follow-ups that they hardly have a leg of their own to really stand on, as opposed to something like, say FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING which managed to lay huge groundwork, establish its relationships, move its chess pieces, and raise the stakes all with its own individual emotional payoff and a sense of roundedness, i.e. it worked as both a standalone film and as a part of a trilogy. My feeling could change but right now DUNE - PART ONE feels exactly like its final line of dialogue -- \"This is just the beginning...\"\\n\\nThose sandworms though. <PERSON> kills at doing massive scale.   \n",

I’ve seen a couple of <PERSON> films, and I really like how he’s unafraid of bordering on cheesiness with his sentimentality but just keeps so much gravitas within his engaging characters that it doesn’t go too far. The obvious <PERSON> comparisons are apt (from a visual standpoint) but he reminds me wayyy more of <PERSON>-eda. Some serious Our Little Sister type stuff.\\n\\nAll of the performances are fantastic. <PERSON>, <PERSON> and little <PERSON>…Christ, all such naturalistic depictions of grief and <PERSON> just gives them and their characters so much time to breathe. It’s so hard not to fall in love with them. Just pure empathy all around, today’s cinema needs more of it!   \n",

He is the reflection a lot of characters here. Brilliant!\\n\\n<PERSON> and <PERSON>'s scene strike me as very memorable. Great details!\\n\\n\"Do you even know if the person in front of you is the real one you want to meet?\"\\n\\nThat's chicken and egg problem tho. How do we judge a person without records?

Only to go back to the start in the last two minutes. I am generally not a fan of that in movies, except if it's the other way around, but that might be just me.\\n\\nAltogether, it's an alright movie, great cast, interestingly directed, good story, fantastic soundtrack. Do with that what you will, but <PERSON> served cunt and is canonically bisexual here, so that's good enough for me.   \n",

Compelling script, precise direction and ensemble of all great actors.\\n\\nEveryone's so good here. <PERSON> just talked about loss of a child and I cried 😭 She's that good. <PERSON> as the pseudo title double role is loveeeeee. <PERSON> is exactly like the poster!!! He is the reflection a lot of characters here. Brilliant!\\n\\n<PERSON> and <PERSON>'s scene strike me as very memorable. Great details!\\n\\n\"Do you even know if the person in front of you is the real one you want to meet?\"\\n\\nThat's chicken and egg problem tho. How do we judge a person without records?

       "16                                              DNRs\\n\\nSeriously what is the fucking point of DNRing someone if the other people keep letting them come back. As well as the owner and gm???????\\n\\nFor instance one guy stayed a few months back had gotten into it with the owner and has an aggressive pitbull (no not all pitties are aggressive but this one is)\\n\\nThe owner told me to add him to the long list of dnr. Because they smoked in the room has the aggressive dog and trashed the room.\\n\\nThe owner told him not to come back literally to his face.\\n\\nSo i come in after being off yesterday and lowandbehold he has come back. 🙃\\n\\nI say something to the owner but they act like they dont give two shits\\n\\nSo what was the whole big deal last time then?\\n\\nHe comes to the desk today wanting to basically to the standard room and upgrade cause hes a starrbellysneech memeber.\\n\\n(You dont get an upgrade on booked out nights and its only to the suite not studio if its avaliable)\\n\\nAnd of couse they gotta do this at 11 right at check out time. With a fuck ton of shit packed into their room on a (1 night stay)\\n\\nHousekeeping knocks like 4 times they keeps shewing them away so the owner tells the guy hey its 1130 yall need move to the new room.\\n\\nOf cousrse he starts to argue saying i didnt let him check back in Which is a lie.\\n\\nHis phone signal was shit so he had to go outside and book it cause he didnt want to pay the higher rate.\\n\\nFinally it came through and i check him in within like 2 min. So no dude it wasnt me. You knew what time it was your reservation due to your shitty ass broken phone was the one who was fucking it up not me.\\n\\nHe had the dog and it still caost him like 180 woth the pet fee. And i charged it out before he left my desk. He is one of those who will turn their card off. Im making sure we got the money.\\n\\nAnd i blocked out the last standard room on pourpose.\\n\\nAnyway i jsut had a conversation that with the owner as to why... he said cause its been slow and he needs the money. So he got rid of the list that he himself told me to make.\\n\\nWe have not been slow this week almost every night we have been booked out. So spare me the bull shit Nile.\\n\\nI just threw my hands up and said hey om just letting you know. Is what it is.\\n\\nYou wanna argue with the same dumb asses every time go ahead.\\n\\n( i am quiet quitting anyways)\\n\\nI cant take the back and fourth double standard anymore. I do my job and its never good enough.\\n\\nI do one tiny thing wrong and i get reprimanded for it the other 3 dumb shits that work the desk do major fuck up never get anything said to them.\\n\\nJust done trying.\\n\\nIdk anymore what does yalls hotels do with dnrs?   \n",

A poor man’s Dil Chahta Hai- which isn’t a bad thing. The lovelorn <PERSON> is shared between <PERSON> & <PERSON> and the fuckboi character appears an amalgam of <PERSON>’s demeanour and <PERSON> circumstances. But the banter isn’t as natural as it was in DCH.\\n\\nSocial media is used well as its own character but so many movies have successfully done this by now that it doesn’t feel like a big deal. Bit late to the party? The film is most excruciatingly funny during moments of second-hand embarrassment and cringe. You will laugh and wince equally. OAFF’s sophomore album is more inconsistent than his first but he remains one of the more exciting music directors to emerge recently.   \n",

It went undetected by many (including me) and suddenly appeared as a Best Picture nomination. I decided to watch it and am quite glad that I did so.\\n\\nFirst of all, the two leads absolutely carry this film. They delivered stellar performances and easily elevated the effectiveness of this film. They had so much chemistry as mother and son. As another note, that scene with <PERSON> rolling out of the truck almost made me pass out. It was mostly due to the fact that I honestly cared about the fate of the main characters, and that was easily the most suspenseful scene of the film (was so well done too).\\n\\nThe one thing I think I can judge this film on plot wise is that I would've liked to have seen more content from the real world, as well as more on how <PERSON> got into 'Room'.\\n\\nIs Room going to win Best Picture? Probably not. Is <PERSON> going to get Best Actress? She very well could. Whatever the true answers are to these questions, this film was very enjoyable and not an Oscar bait film by any means.   \n",

Don’t run it into the ground.”\\n\\nLost Highway meets Red Zone Cuba. Recursive nightmare logic and paranoiac fugue states. Politically inscrutable ninja cabals carrying out clandestine assassinations. Deep state double agents getting a handle on <PERSON>. <PERSON> letting slide a late career <PERSON>. A paycheck is a paycheck to this none-too-picky Master Ninja. I might have been hallucinating, but I’m pretty sure his earring got slightly bigger in each scene.\\n\\nThis is awful and I loved every minute of it. The middle hour is just people saying the names <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON> and <PERSON> over and over again, and never once was I able to glean the meaning of any of it. I don’t think I could explain the plot of this to you if my life depended on it. Something about terrorism and honor and ninjas and dick measuring. And there’s a ton of weird echoey <PERSON> Voiceover, which I can only intuit is meant to represent his character’s dim-witted inner monologue. He’s like if <PERSON> in <PERSON>’s Dune had a 78 IQ.\\n\\nThere’s actually some decent action in this, with the highlight being the big showdown between <PERSON> and the red-hooded henchman from the killer poster art. I mean, they’re not doing any super impressive choreography or anything, but the fight feels raw and intense and the camera never cuts or shakes around. Sure, it ain’t <PERSON>, but at least it seems like an altercation transpiring between flesh-and-blood human beings on planet earth. Sometimes we forget what that looks and feels like.\\n\\nI caught bits and pieces of this on UHF television when I was maybe 8 or 9 years old in ‘85 or ‘86. It’s fucking hilarious to think of my youngest kids watching The Octagon. Their pop culture upbringing now is as vastly different to what I experienced growing up in the 80’s as mine was to that of the fucking pilgrims. Trying to imagine my angelic daughter sitting through Dirty Harry with commercial breaks on network television at 1PM on a Sunday like I did countless times when I was her age. Fascistic cops ignoring Miranda rights or Mr <PERSON> digging wells and doing cursed speed runs. Kids gotta watch something.\\n\\nLastly, you simply have to respect a movie where the credits roll within .83 seconds of the hero killing the bad guy.   \n",

We meet a troubled security guard named <PERSON> (<PERSON>), who begins working at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. <PERSON> is the sole guardian of his little sister <PERSON> (<PERSON>) after the loss of their mother. He has been trying to find a steady job and provide for her, but it has been hard for him. Amid a custody battle with his aunt, who thinks it’s safer for <PERSON> to go live with her, he finds a job thanks to <PERSON> (<PERSON>). <PERSON> describes the security job, and <PERSON> takes it. It’s pretty straightforward at the beginning until the dream sequences with <PERSON>. His dreams are meant to tell him about the man who had kidnapped his younger brother all those years ago, but all it does is connect him to other children, the ghost children in the animatronic puppets at <PERSON> Pizzeria.\\n\\nOn paper, this sounds interesting, and it had the potential to be a wicked supernatural horror film, but it falls short. The focus on <PERSON> and the actual children took away from the menacing animatronic puppets that do all the killing. Instead of working in the lore from the games, the actual gameplay should have been integrated. It became dream sequences upon dream sequences and only one sequence of the animatronic puppets coming out for the scares. The editing also ruined the tension because once the animatronic puppets were out of the frame and walking through the halls, it would cut to the recurring dream. Understandably, they wanted to make this family-friendly, but the 14A rating did not allow these filmmakers the creative freedom to integrate more kills.\\n\\nclick here for my full review   \n",

Its certainly not as refined as his masterworks, but still full of so much rich storytelling\\n\\n<PERSON> and <PERSON> are the perfect duo, and <PERSON> is clearly having so much fun playing <PERSON>, the perfect mix between his rigid stoicism and feral antics of other roles\\n\\nAs much as I love <PERSON>'s portrayal and the mark he left on the character for <PERSON> to elevate tenfold, this film always makes me so curious as to what <PERSON>'s Obi-Wan would have been like. Would have changed the entire trajectory of Star Wars from the beginning, had he said yes   \n",

He is a 5 year old british shorthair. They did bloodwork and did not find anything wrong with his blood/heart. A neurologist diagnosed him with epilepsy. He started taking the meds 3 weeks ago. He got better the first day but then started getting worst each passing day. When he tries to walk he just falls over all the time. Some days he is just catatonic, doesn’t move any body parts except for his ears. He pees all over the place. His seizures are like this: he falls over and his body gets super stiff, he lifts all his limbs upwards.\\n\\nI’ve never seen epilepsy seizures like his online, so I’m not even sure lf the diagnosis was correct.\\n\\nHe was 5 kg 3 months ago, now he is barely 2 kilograms.\\n\\nHave you experienced anything similar, or have any advice on what to do?   \n",

We have a mixture of hotel guests and locals with monthly memberships using both the hotel and the fitness facility. I've been at this current position for about 11 months and have I got the the crazy stories for you!\\n\\nOne of the stories that is still ongoing is an older club member is always standing by my desk asking me personal questions. I'm friendly for the most part but I don't want you being inappropriate with me. He started one conversation with, \"You get really good discounts, maybe we could share a hotel room.\" Right there I started feeling uncomfortable so I responded with, \"That's not appropriate to ask me in my place of work.\" He apologized and left. He had a couple more run in's with me like that until he invited me to his place. I reported him to the directors of the fitness side because that's a whole different department.\\n\\nOnce I reported him to the directors, he didn't even look at me while passing by! That stopped for a few weeks and then it started up again a few weeks ago. The first thing he did was come up to my desk and tell me how lonely he is. I told him to come to the club and relax with the other club members. He wanted to be my friend and get my number. That too was very inappropriate but I declined. I recently started seeing someone so that would help me. Our old man asked if I was seeing anyone and I said yes! Mr. thinks he's smooth said, \"Oh he's far too old for you, you should give me a chance!\" I looked at him because the guy I'm currently seeing is only three years older than me, not 62 years older than me. I shook my head no and told him that I was happy.\\n\\nThe last time he came in was Friday night. He asked how my little affair was going and I told him it was more than a little affair and I was happy. He then asked more personal questions about the things I do with my new boyfriend. That not right and thankfully one of the club side managers overheard him and told him he is going to report him for sexual harassment. I thanked him but this has been an ongoing problem. He's in the process of losing his membership.   \n",

Watching this felt like two halves of myself were being united — only ever divided by time and age.\\n\\nGoing into this film blind is a must so I don’t wanna give away too much but it’s the perfect blend of the love of making movies, the tenderness of connecting with family through art, and the elevated reworking of a genre so popular in Filipino cinema.\\n\\nAnd the visuals. I can’t not love the visuals.\\n\\nObviously, as a Fil-Am film-maker, I’m gonna be biased but maybe it’s because it feels like home. It feels like I’m back visiting my lola. It feels like when my parents would gush over their precious sari-sari stores.\\n\\nA few days ago, my mom ran up to me excitedly and told me this won the Special Jury Prize for Innovative Spirit at Sundance and that she was listening to the NPR segment with <PERSON>. It’s also the first Filipino film to compete since 2006 with The Blossoming of Maximo Oliveros. I’m sure that majoring in film at a mainly-white institution is a brown mother’s worst nightmare but as the NPR interview segment faded out, I saw hope in her eyes.\\n\\nAlso, anyone who knows me will understand why the last 15ish minutes made me cry but with love.\\n\\n(and thank you to my mother for helping me transcribe the first quote; i understand kapampangan better and it’s been a while since i picked up tagalog from teleseryes)   \n",

I was thrown to the wolves and given very little training. I quickly became lead server, train all the new servers, and handled all the events and VIP’s.\\n\\nI’m not saying all that to show off how good I am, but rather to show the staff was so bad I was good comparatively, and I never received proper training.\\n\\nI got hired at a job last week in an upscale, nearly fine dining place, (doesn’t have a somm on staff) my little sister lead serves at. She got the job with 6 years experience serving. They usually require years of experience, but they are aware of my less than three months of experience and decided to hire me despite it.\\n\\nI have my first shift tomorrow, and going over the food and drink menu is giving me huge imposter syndrome. I’ve never received a job through nepotism before. There are words for food I’ve never even seen or know how to pronounce. I’ve never been so unprepared for a job. I’ve never even eaten at a fine dining establishment.\\n\\nThe more I learn, the more I learn I don’t know. There is no way I’m going to be able to memorize everything on the menu’s by my first shift tomorrow which was my goal. I still have no idea about any of the etiquette such as language, place settings, wine pairings, etc. Any help or tips would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading this far!   \n",

Nor does the word “complicated” seem sufficient. Of course the tortured genius, Promethean mythology is in the foreground and is clearly in many ways a proxy for himself (albeit only operating on a single level of self awareness) but <PERSON> makes no attempt to conceal the horror not just of the event but of the idea that a moral objective cannot compete against ego. But punishment is not absolution, in the eyes of the public or within. To me the final 40 minutes feels like a reprise of <PERSON>’s comment to him in the woods: when reckless self interest leads to destruction, do not expect they will indulge you your guilt.   \n",

I walk over there and show him the items and recommend which one he should get, because I have a lot of knowledge on the items. He asks some questions, dumb ones, and pauses for a minute between each, but nothing out of the ordinary. I say yes sir to a question he repeated and begin to walk away.\\n\\nHe starts slowly trying to make up another question as i’m walking away. A stupid question with the most obvious answer printed on the front of the box. Then i start to walk away again.\\n\\nHe stops me again and says “so it will work then??” after i just said it will work at least 3 or 4 times by now.\\n\\nBruh what the actual fuck. It’s really getting to the point where it’s 2 out of 3 customers who are fucking rude as hell, absolute idiots who are dumber than bricks, or just completely helpless and think you’re their personal assistant there for there every need.\\n\\nLike people are so damn useless they can’t figure anything out for themselves. They need their hand held for everything. These customers suck.\\n\\nBut I swear it’s getting worse every week!!! Like I am LITERALLY MIND BLOWN by how stupid people are on an hourly basis. Some of these questions I genuinely can’t believe they are asking. Like no fucking way you’re that stupid!   \n",

Timeframe was a complete horror. You may ask yourself why?\\nHe had two weeks to get a working concept with ordering the hardware, prep it and test\\n\\nAfter the hardware was delivered, he went to work, doing a 55-Hour week to set up and test his concept. All went well, and he was sent to the new branch office.\\n\\nIn Switzerland, he went straight to work. He plugged in the NAS and the PSU went POOOFFF. Keep in mind that the NAS is our backbone which hosts a site-to-site VPN, a network drive to share stuff and is our switch between two different internet connections.\\n\\nAfter that, he called us and let us know that he needs more time to organize a new PSU/NAS and an electrician needs to look at the situation. The guy who was called measured the voltage of the outlet. The guy told him, \"Well 411 Volts, I would guess the NAS is doomed.\"\\n\\nAfter that problem with the outlet got sorted and a new PSU was bought. All went well and I am still surprised that the NAS took the hit like a champ. Still working fine after two years.\\n\\nTLDR of the story: Even the best prep can go to waste in seconds   \n",

I understood how much this sucked because I usually have Wednesday off for the mrs and Thursdays off for my boys high school football games. Varsity plays Fridays.

I am a very joking person so I don’t take playful comments too seriously but she has made comments that were actually mean, and I wanted to keep track in case we ever asked to review her as a manager. I work at a bank: 1. I have asthma and one day I knew an attack was coming on, so I needed to leave. It was 5:27pm and I was scheduled until 5:30PM. I asked to leave she said “You’re making a habit of this”. Mind you I have only missed work once, because I fainted doing hot yoga. I made it known I had asthma from the beginning. Now even when I am having asthma I don’t mention it to anyone.\\n\\n1. All of my coworkers were going out to lunch with for her and another coworkers birthday. She was asking what the best day for everyone (context: I have no family here, and I’m basically alone) Everyone else has families or are married. I was excited and told her I wouldn’t be busy at all so whatever day was decided was good for me, she responded “We weren’t asking you, I didn’t think you would be busy” and laughed.\\n\\n2. Yesterday, we were preparing for for our district manager to visit and I happen to be off the day of. While everyone was debating calling out and nervous, I said “Well, I’m glad to be off” and she said “I’m glad you are too, cause we need our strongest tellers only” I absolutely resented this cause I am in fact the strongest teller. I’m leading in NBS… I also have 100 percent for surveys and customers are constantly raving about my service. One time her own boss told her that if she wanted to suggest me for another position, he would co-sign.\\n\\nI don’t know if because I am a jokester, maybe she thinks these comments are also jokes. I am very respectful of her and honestly all my coworkers joke with each other but not like this at all. We are all passed “professional” jokes as coworkers. We can kind of get away with some off-color jokes like for example our service manager got a BBL so one of my coworkers joked that when we get coins from the vault we can just stack them on her ass.\\n\\nI am a lesbian and we were having an outing, someone suggested we all bring our partners and one of my coworkers said that he wasn’t bringing his wife because I might steal here, I said no we can share and since then he’s been my sister husband.\\n\\nAnyways nothing really malicious, maybe I am being too sensitive? Do you think I should discuss this with her? I don’t want her to feel uncomfortable to joke with me after this. I just don’t want her to be cruel.   \n",

It’s long and grim but so rewatchable to me. <PERSON> gives an amazing performance as the compulsive serial killer, void of empathy. It’s told so well like a book because the audience gets to learn so much about the character and I love how it’s done in chapters and slightly out of order.\\n\\nIt’s comedic at times watching him stumble around a crime scene he needs to clean up, and when he gets annoyed with an incompetent clerk or an abrasive <PERSON>. It’s also terribly ruthless at times but it needs to be to tell the story. And with a satisfying conclusion, all of the pay-off is worth it. Morbid subject matter, maybe yes, but it’s art.   \n",

Everything here is building to that huge Helm’s Deep/March of the Ents/Battle of Osgiliath cross-cutting climax, and it delivers on all fronts, with several soul-stirring speeches and moving moments in between the awesome battle sequences. A beautiful achievement.\\n\\nAnd it’s of course telling that said stretch of the film is the one that is touched the least by this extended edition. I’m not gonna overly rag on it, but the problems remain: neutered pacing and double beats galore. Oh well!\\n\\nI started to doze off a few times here, which doesn’t bode well for the four and a half hour finale yet to come.   \n",

First thought was “eh it’s a Netflix original that came straight to streaming, how good could it be?” Which might be one reason why my rating is so high.\\n\\nI actually really enjoyed the fact that we’re in the dark for the entirety of the film. We know as much as the characters do and left to guess how this will turn out in the end. Also maybe the Friends references got a little annoying but I used to be a 13-year-old girl, and no one could’ve stopped her her on her mission.\\n\\nA few things were out of place and I wished I could’ve seen more of <PERSON>, but otherwise I enjoyed this a lot. The performances were great and the story was well done and fresh for a plot line that has been done so many times.\\n\\nA review that’s an actual review instead of a witty one sentence-er so you know I’m for real   \n",

I’ve seen a couple of <PERSON> films, and I really like how he’s unafraid of bordering on cheesiness with his sentimentality but just keeps so much gravitas within his engaging characters that it doesn’t go too far. The obvious <PERSON> comparisons are apt (from a visual standpoint) but he reminds me wayyy more of <PERSON>-eda. Some serious Our Little Sister type stuff.\\n\\nAll of the performances are fantastic. <PERSON>, <PERSON> and little <PERSON>…Christ, all such naturalistic depictions of grief and <PERSON> just gives them and their characters so much time to breathe. It’s so hard not to fall in love with them. Just pure empathy all around, today’s cinema needs more of it!   \n",

It never apologizes for its strange story directions, but it does still maintain a sense of sincerity.\\n\\nChapter 2 crosses that line a bit more, ramping up the ridiculousness (which I love), as well as some of the more pervasive silliness (which I don’t love as much). As much as I can suspend my disbelief and invest in the absurd time-traveling ghosts angle, it is harder to do so when the two ghost hunters are constantly joking around and making quips. Their presence in the first was relatively reserved, but here it’s a bit too much.\\n\\nThat said, I really do love how weird this story gets, and it still maintains that signature <PERSON> style.   \n",

Everyone was so desensitized to terror that horror movies needed to be next-level grisly to get people’s attention. The rise of torture porn is all over this movie, and that’s just the theatrical cut ( the director’s cut has a deeply unpleasant and very unnecessary rape scene. Do not watch it).   \n",

Gonna give it a week or two and maybe another viewing. It’s beautifully made and it really commits, as does everyone who appears in it. A lot less funny than In Bruges but a lot less clunky as a drama than Three Billboards, he did find a good balance this time.   \n",

She gives one of my favorite performances of 2022 and I really do hope she gets more roles that show off her acting abilities like this one! The cinematography gives off old movie vibes and I could not get enough of it! The huge ass monologue near the end of the movie blew me away because honestly I wasn’t expecting it to be in the movie! The movie genuinely scared me and made me uncomfortable on multiple occasions (mainly that scarecrow scene the less said the better) <PERSON> and <PERSON> did a amazing job of making us feel as isolated from the world as <PERSON>! So yeah I adored this movie! Go check it out and also go watch (X) you won’t regret it!   \n",

But on the other hand, I’ve also at times been like <PERSON> (selfish, neurotic), and met people like <PERSON> (fumbling, passionate). They’re very real characters, much moreso than in almost anything else <PERSON>’s ever made - it’s definitely his romcom. But — I like it less than I did. Maybe his schtick is more grating to me now than it was, or maybe I just found parts of it a little dull, but honestly I almost preferred Manhattan… Anyway, this is one of those movies where I can never seem to remember the ending even after seeing it 3 times. No clue if it’ll stick now, but at least I’ve seen it again.   \n",
